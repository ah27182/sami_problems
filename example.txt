Tenth Ward: The most prominent diseases during the past year have been
phthisis, typhoid and scarlet fevers, cholera infantum, dysentery,
smallpox, and diphtheria. They were most prevalent in the poorest part
of the district, having the lowest ground, the filthiest streets, and
the most dense population of poor and careless people, who are crowded
in the numerous tenant-houses, shanties, and small dwellings, which
were built for one or two families, but are now made to contain from
five to ten.

Nineteenth Ward: The diseases that have chiefly prevailed during the
past season are dysentery, diarrhoea, cholera morbus, cholera infantum
and the exanthematous fevers. They were of the most frequent occurrence
in the most crowded and insalubrious quarters.

Fifteenth Ward: Since the commencement of the survey, scarlet fever,
typhoid fever, smallpox, and cholera infantum have prevailed in the
tenant-houses of this ward. Six cases of smallpox occurred in one of
three thickly peopled rows of such dwellings, and the disease was
communicated to a child in an adjacent street, who had been playing in
the infected neighborhood. Seven cases of typhoid also occurred in a
court among children, and this was within a few doors of better class
houses.

Eleventh Ward: Typhus and typhoid fevers have been found prevailing
in all sections of this district. Smallpox, scarlatina, measles, and
pulmonary diseases are met with in almost every street. Typhus is the
most typical of the preventable diseases that abound in the Eleventh
Ward. Cholera infantum and obstinate diarrhoeal maladies were prevalent
in the rear tenements and throughout the lowest streets during the
summer and autumn.

To give you an idea of the wide prevalence of these diseases, I will
notice one or two more in detail.


[Sidenote: Smallpox]

Smallpox is the very type of preventable diseases. We have a safe
and sure preventive in thorough vaccination. And yet this loathsome
disease is at this moment an epidemic in New York. In two days' time,
the inspectors found 644 cases, and in two weeks, upward of 1,200;
and it was estimated that only about one-half were discovered. In
many large tenant-houses, six, eight, and ten cases were found at the
same time. They found it under every conceivable condition tending to
promote its communicability. It was in the street cars, in the stages,
in the hacks, on the ferry-boats, in junk-shops, in cigar-stores,
in candy-shops, in the families of tailors and seamstresses, who
were making clothing for wholesale stores, in public and in private
charities. I hold in my hand a list of cases of smallpox found
existing under circumstances which show how widespread is this disease.
Bedding of a fatal case of smallpox was sold to a rag-man; case in a
room where candy and daily papers were sold; case on a ferry-boat;
woman was attending bar and acting as nurse to her husband who had
smallpox; girl who was making cigars while scabs were falling from her
skin; seamstress who was making shirts for a Broadway store, one of
which was thrown over the cradle of a child sick of smallpox; tailors
making soldiers' clothing, have their children, from whom the scabs
were falling, wrapped in the garments; a woman selling vegetables had
the scabs falling from her face, among the vegetables, etc., etc.
Instances of this kind can be quoted at any length, but these examples
are sufficient to show that smallpox spreads uncontrolled throughout
our city. And they show, too, how this disease is disseminated abroad.
Says the Inspector of the Fourth Ward:


[Sidenote: Smallpox in Tailored Garments]

"In localities where smallpox prevailed I found, in some instances
within a few feet of the patients, tailors at work for our best
clothing establishments. Such infected vestments--worse than the tunic
of the Centaur--bring disease and death not only to the wearers, but
to many others. The occupant of the crowded tenant-house procures from
such a source a coat or a blanket, and soon a loathsome pest attacks
the young and unprotected members of his family, and ultimately spreads
through the entire quarter, destroying life after life and endangering
the health of a whole community.

"Smallpox, suddenly breaking out in some secluded rural district, often
owes its unsuspected origin to the above causes. In the remote solitude
of the ocean the seaman opens the chest in which he has deposited such
obnoxious apparel, and from this Pandora's box scatters the seeds of
pestilence among his comrades, which, ripening, shall spread its germs
to distant ports."

Or, what is more striking, take the following from the report of the
Inspector of the Fifth Ward:

"The largest wholesale establishments for the sale of dry goods
on this side of the Atlantic Ocean are in immediate contact with
the tenant-houses of the worst class, and which are infested with
smallpox and typhus fever. The two freight depots and the principal
passenger depot of the Railroad Company are in the same close
association with these nests of infection. In the region immediately
surrounding are also situated several hotels, and a large number of
boarding-houses, whose inmates are thus in danger of personal contact
with these diseases any moment. West Broadway, running through the
very centre of the district, is traversed by five different lines of
railway cars, with an average of five cars passing every minute, and
carrying millions of passengers yearly by the very doors of these
houses. Broadway, at but a short distance removed, is the principal
thoroughfare of the city. Hudson Street on the west is also a leading
route for city travel; and the cross streets of the district are
traversed daily by multitudes to reach various lines of steamboats,
cars, and steamships, which leave the city opposite this point.

[Illustration: A REGION OF SMALLPOX AND TYPHUS FEVER, 1865]

"All this large amount of daily travel passes through a region always
containing cases of typhus fever, and largely infected with smallpox.
Is it any cause of surprise that cases of these diseases are here
contracted, to be carried to distant sections of the country, there to
develop themselves, to the surprise and alarm of whole neighborhoods?
It is also well to remember that several large livery stables
are located in the immediate neighborhood, whose vehicles, it is
well-known, are frequently employed to carry persons, suffering from
these diseases, to hospitals, or to attend at funerals. These vehicles
are, perhaps, immediately afterward driven to the various car and
steamboat lines to secure passengers, who are thus exposed in the most
dangerous manner to these diseases."


[Sidenote: Typhus Fever]

Second only to smallpox as a preventable disease, but of a more fatal
character, is typhus fever. Typhus is greatly aggravated by domestic
filth, and by overcrowding, with deficient ventilation. The inspectors
found and located by street and number no less than 2,000 cases of this
most contagious and fatal disease. Commencing in a large tenant-house
in Mulberry Street, it was traced from locality to locality, in the
poorer quarters, until it was found to have visited nearly every
section of the city. It became localized in many tenant-houses and
streets, where it still remains, causing a large amount of sickness and
mortality.

At Mulberry Street, in a notoriously filthy house, it has existed
for more than four years. This house has a population of about 320,
which is renewed every few months. During the period alluded to, there
have been no less than 60 deaths by fever in this single house, and
240 cases. To-day this fever is raging uncontrolled in that house,
creating more orphans than many well-fought battles. Every new family
which enters these infected quarters is sure to fall a victim to this
pestilential disease.

[Illustration: PLAN OF FEVER-NEST, EAST 17TH STREET, 1865

_Here 85 Cases of Typhus Occurred in One Season_]

The tenant-house No. -- East Seventeenth Street, which reaks with
filth, gives the same history; upward of 85 cases, with a large
percentage of deaths, occurred in this single house during the past
season. And still it remained unclean and open to new tenants. I
could mention scores of these houses in every part of the tenant-house
district where typhus has apparently taken up its abode, and from
whence it sends out in every direction its deadly streams.

Not only have single houses become centres of contagion, but this
fever has, in many instances, become localized in crowded streets,
which to-day are almost impassable on account of the heaps of garbage,
and the courts and alleys of which are reeking with filth, making
them great centres of pestilence. From many of these tenements whole
families have been swept away.

[Illustration: BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF FEVER-NEST, 1865, NOT FAR FROM
BROADWAY AND FIFTH AVENUE]

Jersey Street, a short but uncleaned avenue, adjacent to a fashionable
part of Broadway, is another great depot of fever, which, according to
these records, frequently contained upward of thirty cases in progress
at one time. East Eleventh Street, between First and Second Avenues,
now, as all the past summer, in a horribly filthy condition, is a
local habitation of fever of the worst type. The same statement may be
made of nearly every district where the tenant-houses are especially
crowded, and the streets, courts, and alleys are unusually filthy.


[Sidenote: Intestinal Affections]

Intestinal diseases, as cholera infantum, diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid
fever, etc., which arise from, or are intensely aggravated by the
emanations from putrescible material in streets, courts, and alleys,
or from cesspools, privies, drain pipes, sewers, etc., were prevalent
in the tenant-house districts, creating, as usual, a vast amount of
sickness, and a large infant mortality. Very generally these diseases
were directly traceable to the decomposing filth, and in some instances
were stopped by the removal of the nuisance.

The Inspector of the Eighth Ward reports: "Cholera infantum has
probably consigned many more to the grave during the past summer than
all other diseases in my inspection district. In every case examined I
have found it associated with some well-marked course of insalubrity;
vegetable and animal decomposition have been the most prominent causes.
That fifty per cent die from preventable causes in my inspection
district I do not doubt."

The Inspector of the Sixth Ward says: "The mortality among children is
fearfully high, many families having lost all their children; others
four out of five or six."
Tenth Ward: The most prominent diseases during the past year have been
phthisis, typhoid and scarlet fevers, cholera infantum, dysentery,

were making clothing for wholesale stores, in public and in private
charities. I hold in my hand a list of cases of smallpox found
existing under circumstances which show how widespread is this disease.
Bedding of a fatal case of smallpox was sold to a rag-man; case in a
room where candy and daily papers were sold; case on a ferry-boat;
woman was attending bar and acting as nurse to her husband who had
smallpox; girl who was making cigars while scabs were falling from her
skin; seamstress who was making shirts for a Broadway store, one of
which was thrown over the cradle of a child sick of smallpox; tailors
making soldiers' clothing, have their children, from whom the scabs
were falling, wrapped in the garments; a woman selling vegetables had
the scabs falling from her face, among the vegetables, etc., etc.
Instances of this kind can be quoted at any length, but these examples
are sufficient to show that smallpox spreads uncontrolled throughout
our city. And they show, too, how this disease is disseminated abroad.
Says the Inspector of the Fourth Ward:


[Sidenote: Smallpox in Tailored Garments]

"In localities where smallpox prevailed I found, in some instances
within a few feet of the patients, tailors at work for our best
clothing establishments. Such infected vestments--worse than the tunic
of the Centaur--bring disease and death not only to the wearers, but
to many others. The occupant of the crowded tenant-house procures from
such a source a coat or a blanket, and soon a loathsome pest attacks
the young and unprotected members of his family, and ultimately spreads
through the entire quarter, destroying life after life and endangering
the health of a whole community.

"Smallpox, suddenly breaking out in some secluded rural district, often
owes its unsuspected origin to the above causes. In the remote solitude
of the ocean the seaman opens the chest in which he has deposited such
obnoxious apparel, and from this Pandora's box scatters the seeds of
pestilence among his comrades, which, ripening, shall spread its germs
to distant ports."

Or, what is more striking, take the following from the report of the
Inspector of the Fifth Ward:

"The largest wholesale establishments for the sale of dry goods
on this side of the Atlantic Ocean are in immediate contact with
the tenant-houses of the worst class, and which are infested with
smallpox and typhus fever. The two freight depots and the principal
passenger depot of the Railroad Company are in the same close
association with these nests of infection. In the region immediately
surrounding are also situated several hotels, and a large number of
boarding-houses, whose inmates are thus in danger of personal contact
with these diseases any moment. West Broadway, running through the
very centre of the district, is traversed by five different lines of
railway cars, with an average of five cars passing every minute, and
carrying millions of passengers yearly by the very doors of these
houses. Broadway, at but a short distance removed, is the principal
thoroughfare of the city. Hudson Street on the west is also a leading
route for city travel; and the cross streets of the district are
traversed daily by multitudes to reach various lines of steamboats,
cars, and steamships, which leave the city opposite this point.

[Illustration: A REGION OF SMALLPOX AND TYPHUS FEVER, 1865]

"All this large amount of daily travel passes through a region always
containing cases of typhus fever, and largely infected with smallpox.
Is it any cause of surprise that cases of these diseases are here
contracted, to be carried to distant sections of the country, there to
develop themselves, to the surprise and alarm of whole neighborhoods?
It is also well to remember that several large livery stables
are located in the immediate neighborhood, whose vehicles, it is
well-known, are frequently employed to carry persons, suffering from
these diseases, to hospitals, or to attend at funerals. These vehicles
are, perhaps, immediately afterward driven to the various car and
steamboat lines to secure passengers, who are thus exposed in the most
dangerous manner to these diseases."


[Sidenote: Typhus Fever]

Second only to smallpox as a preventable disease, but of a more fatal
character, is typhus fever. Typhus is greatly aggravated by domestic
filth, and by overcrowding, with deficient ventilation. The inspectors
found and located by street and number no less than 2,000 cases of this
most contagious and fatal disease. Commencing in a large tenant-house
in Mulberry Street, it was traced from locality to locality, in the
poorer quarters, until it was found to have visited nearly every
section of the city. It became localized in many tenant-houses and
streets, where it still remains, causing a large amount of sickness and
mortality.

At Mulberry Street, in a notoriously filthy house, it has existed
for more than four years. This house has a population of about 320,
which is renewed every few months. During the period alluded to, there
have been no less than 60 deaths by fever in this single house, and
240 cases. To-day this fever is raging uncontrolled in that house,
creating more orphans than many well-fought battles. Every new family
which enters these infected quarters is sure to fall a victim to this
pestilential disease.

[Illustration: PLAN OF FEVER-NEST, EAST 17TH STREET, 1865

_Here 85 Cases of Typhus Occurred in One Season_]

The tenant-house No. -- East Seventeenth Street, which reaks with
filth, gives the same history; upward of 85 cases, with a large
percentage of deaths, occurred in this single house during the past
season. And still it remained unclean and open to new tenants. I
could mention scores of these houses in every part of the tenant-house
district where typhus has apparently taken up its abode, and from
whence it sends out in every direction its deadly streams.

Not only have single houses become centres of contagion, but this
fever has, in many instances, become localized in crowded streets,
which to-day are almost impassable on account of the heaps of garbage,
and the courts and alleys of which are reeking with filth, making
them great centres of pestilence. From many of these tenements whole
families have been swept away.

[Illustration: BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF FEVER-NEST, 1865, NOT FAR FROM
BROADWAY AND FIFTH AVENUE]

Jersey Street, a short but uncleaned avenue, adjacent to a fashionable
part of Broadway, is another great depot of fever, which, according to
these records, frequently contained upward of thirty cases in progress
at one time. East Eleventh Street, between First and Second Avenues,
now, as all the past summer, in a horribly filthy condition, is a
local habitation of fever of the worst type. The same statement may be
made of nearly every district where the tenant-houses are especially
crowded, and the streets, courts, and alleys are unusually filthy.


[Sidenote: Intestinal Affections]

Intestinal diseases, as cholera infantum, diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid
fever, etc., which arise from, or are intensely aggravated by the
emanations from putrescible material in streets, courts, and alleys,
or from cesspools, privies, drain pipes, sewers, etc., were prevalent
in the tenant-house districts, creating, as usual, a vast amount of
sickness, and a large infant mortality. Very generally these diseases
were directly traceable to the decomposing filth, and in some instances
were stopped by the removal of the nuisance.

The Inspector of the Eighth Ward reports: "Cholera infantum has
probably consigned many more to the grave during the past summer than
all other diseases in my inspection district. In every case examined I
have found it associated with some well-marked course of insalubrity;
vegetable and animal decomposition have been the most prominent causes.
That fifty per cent die from preventable causes in my inspection
district I do not doubt."

The Inspector of the Sixth Ward says: "The mortality among children is
fearfully high, many families having lost all their children; others
four out of five or six."
Tenth Ward: The most prominent diseases during the past year have been
phthisis, typhoid and scarlet fevers, cholera infantum, dysentery,
smallpox, and diphtheria. They were most prevalent in the poorest part
of the district, having the lowest ground, the filthiest streets, and
the most dense population of poor and careless people, who are crowded
in the numerous tenant-houses, shanties, and small dwellings, which
were built for one or two families, but are now made to contain from
five to ten.

Nineteenth Ward: The diseases that have chiefly prevailed during the
past season are dysentery, diarrhoea, cholera morbus, cholera infantum
and the exanthematous fevers. They were of the most frequent occurrence
in the most crowded and insalubrious quarters.

Fifteenth Ward: Since the commencement of the survey, scarlet fever,
typhoid fever, smallpox, and cholera infantum have prevailed in the
tenant-houses of this ward. Six cases of smallpox occurred in one of
three thickly peopled rows of such dwellings, and the disease was
communicated to a child in an adjacent street, who had been playing in
the infected neighborhood. Seven cases of typhoid also occurred in a
court among children, and this was within a few doors of better class
houses.

Eleventh Ward: Typhus and typhoid fevers have been found prevailing
in all sections of this district. Smallpox, scarlatina, measles, and
pulmonary diseases are met with in almost every street. Typhus is the
most typical of the preventable diseases that abound in the Eleventh
Ward. Cholera infantum and obstinate diarrhoeal maladies were prevalent
in the rear tenements and throughout the lowest streets during the
summer and autumn.

To give you an idea of the wide prevalence of these diseases, I will
notice one or two more in detail.


[Sidenote: Smallpox]

Smallpox is the very type of preventable diseases. We have a safe
and sure preventive in thorough vaccination. And yet this loathsome
disease is at this moment an epidemic in New York. In two days' time,
the inspectors found 644 cases, and in two weeks, upward of 1,200;
and it was estimated that only about one-half were discovered. In
many large tenant-houses, six, eight, and ten cases were found at the
same time. They found it under every conceivable condition tending to
promote its communicability. It was in the street cars, in the stages,
in the hacks, on the ferry-boats, in junk-shops, in cigar-stores,
in candy-shops, in the families of tailors and seamstresses, who
were making clothing for wholesale stores, in public and in private
charities. I hold in my hand a list of cases of smallpox found

passenger depot of the Railroad Company are in the same close
association with these nests of infection. In the region immediately
surrounding are also situated several hotels, and a large number of
boarding-houses, whose inmates are thus in danger of personal contact
with these diseases any moment. West Broadway, running through the
very centre of the district, is traversed by five different lines of
railway cars, with an average of five cars passing every minute, and
carrying millions of passengers yearly by the very doors of these
houses. Broadway, at but a short distance removed, is the principal
thoroughfare of the city. Hudson Street on the west is also a leading
route for city travel; and the cross streets of the district are
traversed daily by multitudes to reach various lines of steamboats,
cars, and steamships, which leave the city opposite this point.

[Illustration: A REGION OF SMALLPOX AND TYPHUS FEVER, 1865]

"All this large amount of daily travel passes through a region always
containing cases of typhus fever, and largely infected with smallpox.
Is it any cause of surprise that cases of these diseases are here
contracted, to be carried to distant sections of the country, there to
develop themselves, to the surprise and alarm of whole neighborhoods?
It is also well to remember that several large livery stables
are located in the immediate neighborhood, whose vehicles, it is
well-known, are frequently employed to carry persons, suffering from
these diseases, to hospitals, or to attend at funerals. These vehicles
are, perhaps, immediately afterward driven to the various car and
steamboat lines to secure passengers, who are thus exposed in the most
dangerous manner to these diseases."


[Sidenote: Typhus Fever]

Second only to smallpox as a preventable disease, but of a more fatal
character, is typhus fever. Typhus is greatly aggravated by domestic
filth, and by overcrowding, with deficient ventilation. The inspectors
found and located by street and number no less than 2,000 cases of this
most contagious and fatal disease. Commencing in a large tenant-house
in Mulberry Street, it was traced from locality to locality, in the
poorer quarters, until it was found to have visited nearly every
section of the city. It became localized in many tenant-houses and
streets, where it still remains, causing a large amount of sickness and
mortality.

At Mulberry Street, in a notoriously filthy house, it has existed
for more than four years. This house has a population of about 320,
which is renewed every few months. During the period alluded to, there
have been no less than 60 deaths by fever in this single house, and
240 cases. To-day this fever is raging uncontrolled in that house,
creating more orphans than many well-fought battles. Every new family
which enters these infected quarters is sure to fall a victim to this
pestilential disease.

[Illustration: PLAN OF FEVER-NEST, EAST 17TH STREET, 1865

_Here 85 Cases of Typhus Occurred in One Season_]

The tenant-house No. -- East Seventeenth Street, which reaks with
filth, gives the same history; upward of 85 cases, with a large
percentage of deaths, occurred in this single house during the past
season. And still it remained unclean and open to new tenants. I
could mention scores of these houses in every part of the tenant-house
district where typhus has apparently taken up its abode, and from
whence it sends out in every direction its deadly streams.

Not only have single houses become centres of contagion, but this
fever has, in many instances, become localized in crowded streets,
which to-day are almost impassable on account of the heaps of garbage,
and the courts and alleys of which are reeking with filth, making
them great centres of pestilence. From many of these tenements whole
families have been swept away.

[Illustration: BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF FEVER-NEST, 1865, NOT FAR FROM
BROADWAY AND FIFTH AVENUE]

Jersey Street, a short but uncleaned avenue, adjacent to a fashionable
part of Broadway, is another great depot of fever, which, according to
these records, frequently contained upward of thirty cases in progress
at one time. East Eleventh Street, between First and Second Avenues,
now, as all the past summer, in a horribly filthy condition, is a
local habitation of fever of the worst type. The same statement may be
made of nearly every district where the tenant-houses are especially
crowded, and the streets, courts, and alleys are unusually filthy.


[Sidenote: Intestinal Affections]

Intestinal diseases, as cholera infantum, diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid
fever, etc., which arise from, or are intensely aggravated by the
emanations from putrescible material in streets, courts, and alleys,
or from cesspools, privies, drain pipes, sewers, etc., were prevalent
in the tenant-house districts, creating, as usual, a vast amount of
sickness, and a large infant mortality. Very generally these diseases
were directly traceable to the decomposing filth, and in some instances
were stopped by the removal of the nuisance.

The Inspector of the Eighth Ward reports: "Cholera infantum has
probably consigned many more to the grave during the past summer than
all other diseases in my inspection district. In every case examined I
have found it associated with some well-marked course of insalubrity;
vegetable and animal decomposition have been the most prominent causes.
That fifty per cent die from preventable causes in my inspection
district I do not doubt."

The Inspector of the Sixth Ward says: "The mortality among children is
fearfully high, many families having lost all their children; others
four out of five or six."
Tenth Ward: The most prominent diseases during the past year have been
phthisis, typhoid and scarlet fevers, cholera infantum, dysentery,
smallpox, and diphtheria. They were most prevalent in the poorest part
of the district, having the lowest ground, the filthiest streets, and
the most dense population of poor and careless people, who are crowded
in the numerous tenant-houses, shanties, and small dwellings, which
were built for one or two families, but are now made to contain from
five to ten.

Nineteenth Ward: The diseases that have chiefly prevailed during the
past season are dysentery, diarrhoea, cholera morbus, cholera infantum
and the exanthematous fevers. They were of the most frequent occurrence
in the most crowded and insalubrious quarters.

Fifteenth Ward: Since the commencement of the survey, scarlet fever,
typhoid fever, smallpox, and cholera infantum have prevailed in the
tenant-houses of this ward. Six cases of smallpox occurred in one of
three thickly peopled rows of such dwellings, and the disease was
communicated to a child in an adjacent street, who had been playing in
the infected neighborhood. Seven cases of typhoid also occurred in a
court among children, and this was within a few doors of better class
houses.

Eleventh Ward: Typhus and typhoid fevers have been found prevailing
in all sections of this district. Smallpox, scarlatina, measles, and
pulmonary diseases are met with in almost every street. Typhus is the
most typical of the preventable diseases that abound in the Eleventh
Ward. Cholera infantum and obstinate diarrhoeal maladies were prevalent
in the rear tenements and throughout the lowest streets during the
summer and autumn.

To give you an idea of the wide prevalence of these diseases, I will
notice one or two more in detail.


[Sidenote: Smallpox]

Smallpox is the very type of preventable diseases. We have a safe
and sure preventive in thorough vaccination. And yet this loathsome
disease is at this moment an epidemic in New York. In two days' time,
the inspectors found 644 cases, and in two weeks, upward of 1,200;
and it was estimated that only about one-half were discovered. In
many large tenant-houses, six, eight, and ten cases were found at the
same time. They found it under every conceivable condition tending to
promote its communicability. It was in the street cars, in the stages,
in the hacks, on the ferry-boats, in junk-shops, in cigar-stores,
in candy-shops, in the families of tailors and seamstresses, who
were making clothing for wholesale stores, in public and in private
charities. I hold in my hand a list of cases of smallpox found
existing under circumstances which show how widespread is this disease.
Bedding of a fatal case of smallpox was sold to a rag-man; case in a
room where candy and daily papers were sold; case on a ferry-boat;
woman was attending bar and acting as nurse to her husband who had
smallpox; girl who was making cigars while scabs were falling from her
skin; seamstress who was making shirts for a Broadway store, one of
which was thrown over the cradle of a child sick of smallpox; tailors
making soldiers' clothing, have their children, from whom the scabs
were falling, wrapped in the garments; a woman selling vegetables had
the scabs falling from her face, among the vegetables, etc., etc.
Instances of this kind can be quoted at any length, but these examples
are sufficient to show that smallpox spreads uncontrolled throughout
our city. And they show, too, how this disease is disseminated abroad.
Says the Inspector of the Fourth Ward:


[Sidenote: Smallpox in Tailored Garments]

"In localities where smallpox prevailed I found, in some instances
within a few feet of the patients, tailors at work for our best
clothing establishments. Such infected vestments--worse than the tunic
of the Centaur--bring disease and death not only to the wearers, but
to many others. The occupant of the crowded tenant-house procures from
such a source a coat or a blanket, and soon a loathsome pest attacks
the young and unprotected members of his family, and ultimately spreads
through the entire quarter, destroying life after life and endangering
the health of a whole community.

"Smallpox, suddenly breaking out in some secluded rural district, often
owes its unsuspected origin to the above causes. In the remote solitude
of the ocean the seaman opens the chest in which he has deposited such
obnoxious apparel, and from this Pandora's box scatters the seeds of
pestilence among his comrades, which, ripening, shall spread its germs
to distant ports."

Or, what is more striking, take the following from the report of the
Inspector of the Fifth Ward:

"The largest wholesale establishments for the sale of dry goods
on this side of the Atlantic Ocean are in immediate contact with
the tenant-houses of the worst class, and which are infested with
smallpox and typhus fever. The two freight depots and the principal
passenger depot of the Railroad Company are in the same close
association with these nests of infection. In the region immediately

which is renewed every few months. During the period alluded to, there
have been no less than 60 deaths by fever in this single house, and
240 cases. To-day this fever is raging uncontrolled in that house,
creating more orphans than many well-fought battles. Every new family
which enters these infected quarters is sure to fall a victim to this
pestilential disease.

[Illustration: PLAN OF FEVER-NEST, EAST 17TH STREET, 1865

_Here 85 Cases of Typhus Occurred in One Season_]

The tenant-house No. -- East Seventeenth Street, which reaks with
filth, gives the same history; upward of 85 cases, with a large
percentage of deaths, occurred in this single house during the past
season. And still it remained unclean and open to new tenants. I
could mention scores of these houses in every part of the tenant-house
district where typhus has apparently taken up its abode, and from
whence it sends out in every direction its deadly streams.

Not only have single houses become centres of contagion, but this
fever has, in many instances, become localized in crowded streets,
which to-day are almost impassable on account of the heaps of garbage,
and the courts and alleys of which are reeking with filth, making
them great centres of pestilence. From many of these tenements whole
families have been swept away.

[Illustration: BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF FEVER-NEST, 1865, NOT FAR FROM
BROADWAY AND FIFTH AVENUE]

Jersey Street, a short but uncleaned avenue, adjacent to a fashionable
part of Broadway, is another great depot of fever, which, according to
these records, frequently contained upward of thirty cases in progress
at one time. East Eleventh Street, between First and Second Avenues,
now, as all the past summer, in a horribly filthy condition, is a
local habitation of fever of the worst type. The same statement may be
made of nearly every district where the tenant-houses are especially
crowded, and the streets, courts, and alleys are unusually filthy.


[Sidenote: Intestinal Affections]

Intestinal diseases, as cholera infantum, diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid
fever, etc., which arise from, or are intensely aggravated by the
emanations from putrescible material in streets, courts, and alleys,
or from cesspools, privies, drain pipes, sewers, etc., were prevalent
in the tenant-house districts, creating, as usual, a vast amount of
sickness, and a large infant mortality. Very generally these diseases
were directly traceable to the decomposing filth, and in some instances
were stopped by the removal of the nuisance.

The Inspector of the Eighth Ward reports: "Cholera infantum has
probably consigned many more to the grave during the past summer than
all other diseases in my inspection district. In every case examined I
have found it associated with some well-marked course of insalubrity;
vegetable and animal decomposition have been the most prominent causes.
That fifty per cent die from preventable causes in my inspection
district I do not doubt."

The Inspector of the Sixth Ward says: "The mortality among children is
fearfully high, many families having lost all their children; others
four out of five or six."
Tenth Ward: The most prominent diseases during the past year have been
phthisis, typhoid and scarlet fevers, cholera infantum, dysentery,
smallpox, and diphtheria. They were most prevalent in the poorest part
of the district, having the lowest ground, the filthiest streets, and
the most dense population of poor and careless people, who are crowded
in the numerous tenant-houses, shanties, and small dwellings, which
were built for one or two families, but are now made to contain from
five to ten.

Nineteenth Ward: The diseases that have chiefly prevailed during the
past season are dysentery, diarrhoea, cholera morbus, cholera infantum
and the exanthematous fevers. They were of the most frequent occurrence
in the most crowded and insalubrious quarters.

Fifteenth Ward: Since the commencement of the survey, scarlet fever,
typhoid fever, smallpox, and cholera infantum have prevailed in the
tenant-houses of this ward. Six cases of smallpox occurred in one of
three thickly peopled rows of such dwellings, and the disease was
communicated to a child in an adjacent street, who had been playing in
the infected neighborhood. Seven cases of typhoid also occurred in a
court among children, and this was within a few doors of better class
houses.

Eleventh Ward: Typhus and typhoid fevers have been found prevailing
in all sections of this district. Smallpox, scarlatina, measles, and
pulmonary diseases are met with in almost every street. Typhus is the
most typical of the preventable diseases that abound in the Eleventh
Ward. Cholera infantum and obstinate diarrhoeal maladies were prevalent
in the rear tenements and throughout the lowest streets during the
summer and autumn.

To give you an idea of the wide prevalence of these diseases, I will
notice one or two more in detail.


[Sidenote: Smallpox]

Smallpox is the very type of preventable diseases. We have a safe
and sure preventive in thorough vaccination. And yet this loathsome
disease is at this moment an epidemic in New York. In two days' time,
the inspectors found 644 cases, and in two weeks, upward of 1,200;
and it was estimated that only about one-half were discovered. In
many large tenant-houses, six, eight, and ten cases were found at the
same time. They found it under every conceivable condition tending to
promote its communicability. It was in the street cars, in the stages,
in the hacks, on the ferry-boats, in junk-shops, in cigar-stores,
in candy-shops, in the families of tailors and seamstresses, who
were making clothing for wholesale stores, in public and in private
charities. I hold in my hand a list of cases of smallpox found
existing under circumstances which show how widespread is this disease.
Bedding of a fatal case of smallpox was sold to a rag-man; case in a
room where candy and daily papers were sold; case on a ferry-boat;
woman was attending bar and acting as nurse to her husband who had
smallpox; girl who was making cigars while scabs were falling from her
skin; seamstress who was making shirts for a Broadway store, one of
which was thrown over the cradle of a child sick of smallpox; tailors
making soldiers' clothing, have their children, from whom the scabs
were falling, wrapped in the garments; a woman selling vegetables had
the scabs falling from her face, among the vegetables, etc., etc.
Instances of this kind can be quoted at any length, but these examples
are sufficient to show that smallpox spreads uncontrolled throughout
our city. And they show, too, how this disease is disseminated abroad.
Says the Inspector of the Fourth Ward:


[Sidenote: Smallpox in Tailored Garments]

"In localities where smallpox prevailed I found, in some instances
within a few feet of the patients, tailors at work for our best
clothing establishments. Such infected vestments--worse than the tunic
of the Centaur--bring disease and death not only to the wearers, but
to many others. The occupant of the crowded tenant-house procures from
such a source a coat or a blanket, and soon a loathsome pest attacks
the young and unprotected members of his family, and ultimately spreads
through the entire quarter, destroying life after life and endangering
the health of a whole community.

"Smallpox, suddenly breaking out in some secluded rural district, often
owes its unsuspected origin to the above causes. In the remote solitude
of the ocean the seaman opens the chest in which he has deposited such
obnoxious apparel, and from this Pandora's box scatters the seeds of
pestilence among his comrades, which, ripening, shall spread its germs
to distant ports."

Or, what is more striking, take the following from the report of the
Inspector of the Fifth Ward:

"The largest wholesale establishments for the sale of dry goods
on this side of the Atlantic Ocean are in immediate contact with
the tenant-houses of the worst class, and which are infested with
smallpox and typhus fever. The two freight depots and the principal
passenger depot of the Railroad Company are in the same close
association with these nests of infection. In the region immediately
surrounding are also situated several hotels, and a large number of
boarding-houses, whose inmates are thus in danger of personal contact
with these diseases any moment. West Broadway, running through the
very centre of the district, is traversed by five different lines of
railway cars, with an average of five cars passing every minute, and
carrying millions of passengers yearly by the very doors of these
houses. Broadway, at but a short distance removed, is the principal
thoroughfare of the city. Hudson Street on the west is also a leading
route for city travel; and the cross streets of the district are
traversed daily by multitudes to reach various lines of steamboats,
cars, and steamships, which leave the city opposite this point.

[Illustration: A REGION OF SMALLPOX AND TYPHUS FEVER, 1865]

"All this large amount of daily travel passes through a region always
containing cases of typhus fever, and largely infected with smallpox.
Is it any cause of surprise that cases of these diseases are here
contracted, to be carried to distant sections of the country, there to
develop themselves, to the surprise and alarm of whole neighborhoods?
It is also well to remember that several large livery stables
are located in the immediate neighborhood, whose vehicles, it is
well-known, are frequently employed to carry persons, suffering from
these diseases, to hospitals, or to attend at funerals. These vehicles
are, perhaps, immediately afterward driven to the various car and
steamboat lines to secure passengers, who are thus exposed in the most
dangerous manner to these diseases."


[Sidenote: Typhus Fever]

Second only to smallpox as a preventable disease, but of a more fatal
character, is typhus fever. Typhus is greatly aggravated by domestic
filth, and by overcrowding, with deficient ventilation. The inspectors
found and located by street and number no less than 2,000 cases of this
most contagious and fatal disease. Commencing in a large tenant-house
in Mulberry Street, it was traced from locality to locality, in the
poorer quarters, until it was found to have visited nearly every
section of the city. It became localized in many tenant-houses and
streets, where it still remains, causing a large amount of sickness and
mortality.

At Mulberry Street, in a notoriously filthy house, it has existed
for more than four years. This house has a population of about 320,

in the tenant-house districts, creating, as usual, a vast amount of
sickness, and a large infant mortality. Very generally these diseases
were directly traceable to the decomposing filth, and in some instances
were stopped by the removal of the nuisance.

The Inspector of the Eighth Ward reports: "Cholera infantum has
probably consigned many more to the grave during the past summer than
all other diseases in my inspection district. In every case examined I
have found it associated with some well-marked course of insalubrity;
vegetable and animal decomposition have been the most prominent causes.
That fifty per cent die from preventable causes in my inspection
district I do not doubt."

The Inspector of the Sixth Ward says: "The mortality among children is
fearfully high, many families having lost all their children; others
four out of five or six."
Tenth Ward: The most prominent diseases during the past year have been
phthisis, typhoid and scarlet fevers, cholera infantum, dysentery,
smallpox, and diphtheria. They were most prevalent in the poorest part
of the district, having the lowest ground, the filthiest streets, and
the most dense population of poor and careless people, who are crowded
in the numerous tenant-houses, shanties, and small dwellings, which
were built for one or two families, but are now made to contain from
five to ten.

Nineteenth Ward: The diseases that have chiefly prevailed during the
past season are dysentery, diarrhoea, cholera morbus, cholera infantum
and the exanthematous fevers. They were of the most frequent occurrence
in the most crowded and insalubrious quarters.

Fifteenth Ward: Since the commencement of the survey, scarlet fever,
typhoid fever, smallpox, and cholera infantum have prevailed in the
tenant-houses of this ward. Six cases of smallpox occurred in one of
three thickly peopled rows of such dwellings, and the disease was
communicated to a child in an adjacent street, who had been playing in
the infected neighborhood. Seven cases of typhoid also occurred in a
court among children, and this was within a few doors of better class
houses.

Eleventh Ward: Typhus and typhoid fevers have been found prevailing
in all sections of this district. Smallpox, scarlatina, measles, and
pulmonary diseases are met with in almost every street. Typhus is the
most typical of the preventable diseases that abound in the Eleventh
Ward. Cholera infantum and obstinate diarrhoeal maladies were prevalent
in the rear tenements and throughout the lowest streets during the
summer and autumn.

To give you an idea of the wide prevalence of these diseases, I will
notice one or two more in detail.


[Sidenote: Smallpox]

Smallpox is the very type of preventable diseases. We have a safe
and sure preventive in thorough vaccination. And yet this loathsome
disease is at this moment an epidemic in New York. In two days' time,
the inspectors found 644 cases, and in two weeks, upward of 1,200;
and it was estimated that only about one-half were discovered. In
many large tenant-houses, six, eight, and ten cases were found at the
same time. They found it under every conceivable condition tending to
promote its communicability. It was in the street cars, in the stages,
in the hacks, on the ferry-boats, in junk-shops, in cigar-stores,
in candy-shops, in the families of tailors and seamstresses, who
were making clothing for wholesale stores, in public and in private
charities. I hold in my hand a list of cases of smallpox found
existing under circumstances which show how widespread is this disease.
Bedding of a fatal case of smallpox was sold to a rag-man; case in a
room where candy and daily papers were sold; case on a ferry-boat;
woman was attending bar and acting as nurse to her husband who had
smallpox; girl who was making cigars while scabs were falling from her
skin; seamstress who was making shirts for a Broadway store, one of
which was thrown over the cradle of a child sick of smallpox; tailors
making soldiers' clothing, have their children, from whom the scabs
were falling, wrapped in the garments; a woman selling vegetables had
the scabs falling from her face, among the vegetables, etc., etc.
Instances of this kind can be quoted at any length, but these examples
are sufficient to show that smallpox spreads uncontrolled throughout
our city. And they show, too, how this disease is disseminated abroad.
Says the Inspector of the Fourth Ward:


[Sidenote: Smallpox in Tailored Garments]

"In localities where smallpox prevailed I found, in some instances
within a few feet of the patients, tailors at work for our best
clothing establishments. Such infected vestments--worse than the tunic
of the Centaur--bring disease and death not only to the wearers, but
to many others. The occupant of the crowded tenant-house procures from
such a source a coat or a blanket, and soon a loathsome pest attacks
the young and unprotected members of his family, and ultimately spreads
through the entire quarter, destroying life after life and endangering
the health of a whole community.

"Smallpox, suddenly breaking out in some secluded rural district, often
owes its unsuspected origin to the above causes. In the remote solitude
of the ocean the seaman opens the chest in which he has deposited such
obnoxious apparel, and from this Pandora's box scatters the seeds of
pestilence among his comrades, which, ripening, shall spread its germs
to distant ports."

Or, what is more striking, take the following from the report of the
Inspector of the Fifth Ward:

"The largest wholesale establishments for the sale of dry goods
on this side of the Atlantic Ocean are in immediate contact with
the tenant-houses of the worst class, and which are infested with
smallpox and typhus fever. The two freight depots and the principal
passenger depot of the Railroad Company are in the same close
association with these nests of infection. In the region immediately
surrounding are also situated several hotels, and a large number of
boarding-houses, whose inmates are thus in danger of personal contact
with these diseases any moment. West Broadway, running through the
very centre of the district, is traversed by five different lines of
railway cars, with an average of five cars passing every minute, and
carrying millions of passengers yearly by the very doors of these
houses. Broadway, at but a short distance removed, is the principal
thoroughfare of the city. Hudson Street on the west is also a leading
route for city travel; and the cross streets of the district are
traversed daily by multitudes to reach various lines of steamboats,
cars, and steamships, which leave the city opposite this point.

[Illustration: A REGION OF SMALLPOX AND TYPHUS FEVER, 1865]

"All this large amount of daily travel passes through a region always
containing cases of typhus fever, and largely infected with smallpox.
Is it any cause of surprise that cases of these diseases are here
contracted, to be carried to distant sections of the country, there to
develop themselves, to the surprise and alarm of whole neighborhoods?
It is also well to remember that several large livery stables
are located in the immediate neighborhood, whose vehicles, it is
well-known, are frequently employed to carry persons, suffering from
these diseases, to hospitals, or to attend at funerals. These vehicles
are, perhaps, immediately afterward driven to the various car and
steamboat lines to secure passengers, who are thus exposed in the most
dangerous manner to these diseases."


[Sidenote: Typhus Fever]

Second only to smallpox as a preventable disease, but of a more fatal
character, is typhus fever. Typhus is greatly aggravated by domestic
filth, and by overcrowding, with deficient ventilation. The inspectors
found and located by street and number no less than 2,000 cases of this
most contagious and fatal disease. Commencing in a large tenant-house
in Mulberry Street, it was traced from locality to locality, in the
poorer quarters, until it was found to have visited nearly every
section of the city. It became localized in many tenant-houses and
streets, where it still remains, causing a large amount of sickness and
mortality.

At Mulberry Street, in a notoriously filthy house, it has existed
for more than four years. This house has a population of about 320,
which is renewed every few months. During the period alluded to, there
have been no less than 60 deaths by fever in this single house, and
240 cases. To-day this fever is raging uncontrolled in that house,
creating more orphans than many well-fought battles. Every new family
which enters these infected quarters is sure to fall a victim to this
pestilential disease.

[Illustration: PLAN OF FEVER-NEST, EAST 17TH STREET, 1865

_Here 85 Cases of Typhus Occurred in One Season_]

The tenant-house No. -- East Seventeenth Street, which reaks with
filth, gives the same history; upward of 85 cases, with a large
percentage of deaths, occurred in this single house during the past
season. And still it remained unclean and open to new tenants. I
could mention scores of these houses in every part of the tenant-house
district where typhus has apparently taken up its abode, and from
whence it sends out in every direction its deadly streams.

Not only have single houses become centres of contagion, but this
fever has, in many instances, become localized in crowded streets,
which to-day are almost impassable on account of the heaps of garbage,
and the courts and alleys of which are reeking with filth, making
them great centres of pestilence. From many of these tenements whole
families have been swept away.

[Illustration: BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF FEVER-NEST, 1865, NOT FAR FROM
BROADWAY AND FIFTH AVENUE]

Jersey Street, a short but uncleaned avenue, adjacent to a fashionable
part of Broadway, is another great depot of fever, which, according to
these records, frequently contained upward of thirty cases in progress
at one time. East Eleventh Street, between First and Second Avenues,
now, as all the past summer, in a horribly filthy condition, is a
local habitation of fever of the worst type. The same statement may be
made of nearly every district where the tenant-houses are especially
crowded, and the streets, courts, and alleys are unusually filthy.


[Sidenote: Intestinal Affections]

Intestinal diseases, as cholera infantum, diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid
fever, etc., which arise from, or are intensely aggravated by the
emanations from putrescible material in streets, courts, and alleys,
or from cesspools, privies, drain pipes, sewers, etc., were prevalent
in the tenant-house districts, creating, as usual, a vast amount of
sickness, and a large infant mortality. Very generally these diseases

in the rear tenements and throughout the lowest streets during the
summer and autumn.

To give you an idea of the wide prevalence of these diseases, I will
notice one or two more in detail.


[Sidenote: Smallpox]

Smallpox is the very type of preventable diseases. We have a safe
and sure preventive in thorough vaccination. And yet this loathsome
disease is at this moment an epidemic in New York. In two days' time,
the inspectors found 644 cases, and in two weeks, upward of 1,200;
and it was estimated that only about one-half were discovered. In
many large tenant-houses, six, eight, and ten cases were found at the
same time. They found it under every conceivable condition tending to
promote its communicability. It was in the street cars, in the stages,
in the hacks, on the ferry-boats, in junk-shops, in cigar-stores,
in candy-shops, in the families of tailors and seamstresses, who
were making clothing for wholesale stores, in public and in private
charities. I hold in my hand a list of cases of smallpox found
existing under circumstances which show how widespread is this disease.
Bedding of a fatal case of smallpox was sold to a rag-man; case in a
room where candy and daily papers were sold; case on a ferry-boat;
woman was attending bar and acting as nurse to her husband who had
smallpox; girl who was making cigars while scabs were falling from her
skin; seamstress who was making shirts for a Broadway store, one of
which was thrown over the cradle of a child sick of smallpox; tailors
making soldiers' clothing, have their children, from whom the scabs
were falling, wrapped in the garments; a woman selling vegetables had
the scabs falling from her face, among the vegetables, etc., etc.
Instances of this kind can be quoted at any length, but these examples
are sufficient to show that smallpox spreads uncontrolled throughout
our city. And they show, too, how this disease is disseminated abroad.
Says the Inspector of the Fourth Ward:


[Sidenote: Smallpox in Tailored Garments]

"In localities where smallpox prevailed I found, in some instances
within a few feet of the patients, tailors at work for our best
clothing establishments. Such infected vestments--worse than the tunic
of the Centaur--bring disease and death not only to the wearers, but
to many others. The occupant of the crowded tenant-house procures from
such a source a coat or a blanket, and soon a loathsome pest attacks
the young and unprotected members of his family, and ultimately spreads
through the entire quarter, destroying life after life and endangering
the health of a whole community.

"Smallpox, suddenly breaking out in some secluded rural district, often
owes its unsuspected origin to the above causes. In the remote solitude
of the ocean the seaman opens the chest in which he has deposited such
obnoxious apparel, and from this Pandora's box scatters the seeds of
pestilence among his comrades, which, ripening, shall spread its germs
to distant ports."

Or, what is more striking, take the following from the report of the
Inspector of the Fifth Ward:

"The largest wholesale establishments for the sale of dry goods
on this side of the Atlantic Ocean are in immediate contact with
the tenant-houses of the worst class, and which are infested with
smallpox and typhus fever. The two freight depots and the principal
passenger depot of the Railroad Company are in the same close
association with these nests of infection. In the region immediately
surrounding are also situated several hotels, and a large number of
boarding-houses, whose inmates are thus in danger of personal contact
with these diseases any moment. West Broadway, running through the
very centre of the district, is traversed by five different lines of
railway cars, with an average of five cars passing every minute, and
carrying millions of passengers yearly by the very doors of these
houses. Broadway, at but a short distance removed, is the principal
thoroughfare of the city. Hudson Street on the west is also a leading
route for city travel; and the cross streets of the district are
traversed daily by multitudes to reach various lines of steamboats,
cars, and steamships, which leave the city opposite this point.

[Illustration: A REGION OF SMALLPOX AND TYPHUS FEVER, 1865]

"All this large amount of daily travel passes through a region always
containing cases of typhus fever, and largely infected with smallpox.
Is it any cause of surprise that cases of these diseases are here
contracted, to be carried to distant sections of the country, there to
develop themselves, to the surprise and alarm of whole neighborhoods?
It is also well to remember that several large livery stables
are located in the immediate neighborhood, whose vehicles, it is
well-known, are frequently employed to carry persons, suffering from
these diseases, to hospitals, or to attend at funerals. These vehicles
are, perhaps, immediately afterward driven to the various car and
steamboat lines to secure passengers, who are thus exposed in the most
dangerous manner to these diseases."


[Sidenote: Typhus Fever]

Second only to smallpox as a preventable disease, but of a more fatal
character, is typhus fever. Typhus is greatly aggravated by domestic
filth, and by overcrowding, with deficient ventilation. The inspectors
found and located by street and number no less than 2,000 cases of this
most contagious and fatal disease. Commencing in a large tenant-house
in Mulberry Street, it was traced from locality to locality, in the
poorer quarters, until it was found to have visited nearly every
section of the city. It became localized in many tenant-houses and
streets, where it still remains, causing a large amount of sickness and
mortality.

At Mulberry Street, in a notoriously filthy house, it has existed
for more than four years. This house has a population of about 320,
which is renewed every few months. During the period alluded to, there
have been no less than 60 deaths by fever in this single house, and
240 cases. To-day this fever is raging uncontrolled in that house,
creating more orphans than many well-fought battles. Every new family
which enters these infected quarters is sure to fall a victim to this
pestilential disease.

[Illustration: PLAN OF FEVER-NEST, EAST 17TH STREET, 1865

_Here 85 Cases of Typhus Occurred in One Season_]

The tenant-house No. -- East Seventeenth Street, which reaks with
filth, gives the same history; upward of 85 cases, with a large
percentage of deaths, occurred in this single house during the past
season. And still it remained unclean and open to new tenants. I
could mention scores of these houses in every part of the tenant-house
district where typhus has apparently taken up its abode, and from
whence it sends out in every direction its deadly streams.

Not only have single houses become centres of contagion, but this
fever has, in many instances, become localized in crowded streets,
which to-day are almost impassable on account of the heaps of garbage,
and the courts and alleys of which are reeking with filth, making
them great centres of pestilence. From many of these tenements whole
families have been swept away.

[Illustration: BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF FEVER-NEST, 1865, NOT FAR FROM
BROADWAY AND FIFTH AVENUE]

Jersey Street, a short but uncleaned avenue, adjacent to a fashionable
part of Broadway, is another great depot of fever, which, according to
these records, frequently contained upward of thirty cases in progress
at one time. East Eleventh Street, between First and Second Avenues,
now, as all the past summer, in a horribly filthy condition, is a
local habitation of fever of the worst type. The same statement may be
made of nearly every district where the tenant-houses are especially
crowded, and the streets, courts, and alleys are unusually filthy.


[Sidenote: Intestinal Affections]

Intestinal diseases, as cholera infantum, diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid
fever, etc., which arise from, or are intensely aggravated by the
emanations from putrescible material in streets, courts, and alleys,
or from cesspools, privies, drain pipes, sewers, etc., were prevalent
in the tenant-house districts, creating, as usual, a vast amount of
sickness, and a large infant mortality. Very generally these diseases
were directly traceable to the decomposing filth, and in some instances
were stopped by the removal of the nuisance.

The Inspector of the Eighth Ward reports: "Cholera infantum has
probably consigned many more to the grave during the past summer than
all other diseases in my inspection district. In every case examined I
have found it associated with some well-marked course of insalubrity;
vegetable and animal decomposition have been the most prominent causes.
That fifty per cent die from preventable causes in my inspection
district I do not doubt."

The Inspector of the Sixth Ward says: "The mortality among children is
fearfully high, many families having lost all their children; others
four out of five or six."
Tenth Ward: The most prominent diseases during the past year have been
phthisis, typhoid and scarlet fevers, cholera infantum, dysentery,
smallpox, and diphtheria. They were most prevalent in the poorest part
of the district, having the lowest ground, the filthiest streets, and
the most dense population of poor and careless people, who are crowded
in the numerous tenant-houses, shanties, and small dwellings, which
were built for one or two families, but are now made to contain from
five to ten.

Nineteenth Ward: The diseases that have chiefly prevailed during the
past season are dysentery, diarrhoea, cholera morbus, cholera infantum
and the exanthematous fevers. They were of the most frequent occurrence
in the most crowded and insalubrious quarters.

Fifteenth Ward: Since the commencement of the survey, scarlet fever,
typhoid fever, smallpox, and cholera infantum have prevailed in the
tenant-houses of this ward. Six cases of smallpox occurred in one of
three thickly peopled rows of such dwellings, and the disease was
communicated to a child in an adjacent street, who had been playing in
the infected neighborhood. Seven cases of typhoid also occurred in a
court among children, and this was within a few doors of better class
houses.

Eleventh Ward: Typhus and typhoid fevers have been found prevailing
in all sections of this district. Smallpox, scarlatina, measles, and
pulmonary diseases are met with in almost every street. Typhus is the
most typical of the preventable diseases that abound in the Eleventh
Ward. Cholera infantum and obstinate diarrhoeal maladies were prevalent
in the rear tenements and throughout the lowest streets during the
summer and autumn.

such a source a coat or a blanket, and soon a loathsome pest attacks
the young and unprotected members of his family, and ultimately spreads
through the entire quarter, destroying life after life and endangering
the health of a whole community.

"Smallpox, suddenly breaking out in some secluded rural district, often
owes its unsuspected origin to the above causes. In the remote solitude
of the ocean the seaman opens the chest in which he has deposited such
obnoxious apparel, and from this Pandora's box scatters the seeds of
pestilence among his comrades, which, ripening, shall spread its germs
to distant ports."

Or, what is more striking, take the following from the report of the
Inspector of the Fifth Ward:

"The largest wholesale establishments for the sale of dry goods
on this side of the Atlantic Ocean are in immediate contact with
the tenant-houses of the worst class, and which are infested with
smallpox and typhus fever. The two freight depots and the principal
passenger depot of the Railroad Company are in the same close
association with these nests of infection. In the region immediately
surrounding are also situated several hotels, and a large number of
boarding-houses, whose inmates are thus in danger of personal contact
with these diseases any moment. West Broadway, running through the
very centre of the district, is traversed by five different lines of
railway cars, with an average of five cars passing every minute, and
carrying millions of passengers yearly by the very doors of these
houses. Broadway, at but a short distance removed, is the principal
thoroughfare of the city. Hudson Street on the west is also a leading
route for city travel; and the cross streets of the district are
traversed daily by multitudes to reach various lines of steamboats,
cars, and steamships, which leave the city opposite this point.

[Illustration: A REGION OF SMALLPOX AND TYPHUS FEVER, 1865]

"All this large amount of daily travel passes through a region always
containing cases of typhus fever, and largely infected with smallpox.
Is it any cause of surprise that cases of these diseases are here
contracted, to be carried to distant sections of the country, there to
develop themselves, to the surprise and alarm of whole neighborhoods?
It is also well to remember that several large livery stables
are located in the immediate neighborhood, whose vehicles, it is
well-known, are frequently employed to carry persons, suffering from
these diseases, to hospitals, or to attend at funerals. These vehicles
are, perhaps, immediately afterward driven to the various car and
steamboat lines to secure passengers, who are thus exposed in the most
dangerous manner to these diseases."


[Sidenote: Typhus Fever]

Second only to smallpox as a preventable disease, but of a more fatal
character, is typhus fever. Typhus is greatly aggravated by domestic
filth, and by overcrowding, with deficient ventilation. The inspectors
found and located by street and number no less than 2,000 cases of this
most contagious and fatal disease. Commencing in a large tenant-house
in Mulberry Street, it was traced from locality to locality, in the
poorer quarters, until it was found to have visited nearly every
section of the city. It became localized in many tenant-houses and
streets, where it still remains, causing a large amount of sickness and
mortality.

At Mulberry Street, in a notoriously filthy house, it has existed
for more than four years. This house has a population of about 320,
which is renewed every few months. During the period alluded to, there
have been no less than 60 deaths by fever in this single house, and
240 cases. To-day this fever is raging uncontrolled in that house,
creating more orphans than many well-fought battles. Every new family
which enters these infected quarters is sure to fall a victim to this
pestilential disease.

[Illustration: PLAN OF FEVER-NEST, EAST 17TH STREET, 1865

_Here 85 Cases of Typhus Occurred in One Season_]

The tenant-house No. -- East Seventeenth Street, which reaks with
filth, gives the same history; upward of 85 cases, with a large
percentage of deaths, occurred in this single house during the past
season. And still it remained unclean and open to new tenants. I
could mention scores of these houses in every part of the tenant-house
district where typhus has apparently taken up its abode, and from
whence it sends out in every direction its deadly streams.

Not only have single houses become centres of contagion, but this
fever has, in many instances, become localized in crowded streets,
which to-day are almost impassable on account of the heaps of garbage,
and the courts and alleys of which are reeking with filth, making
them great centres of pestilence. From many of these tenements whole
families have been swept away.

[Illustration: BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF FEVER-NEST, 1865, NOT FAR FROM
BROADWAY AND FIFTH AVENUE]

Jersey Street, a short but uncleaned avenue, adjacent to a fashionable
part of Broadway, is another great depot of fever, which, according to
these records, frequently contained upward of thirty cases in progress
at one time. East Eleventh Street, between First and Second Avenues,
now, as all the past summer, in a horribly filthy condition, is a
local habitation of fever of the worst type. The same statement may be
made of nearly every district where the tenant-houses are especially
crowded, and the streets, courts, and alleys are unusually filthy.


[Sidenote: Intestinal Affections]

Intestinal diseases, as cholera infantum, diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid
fever, etc., which arise from, or are intensely aggravated by the
emanations from putrescible material in streets, courts, and alleys,
or from cesspools, privies, drain pipes, sewers, etc., were prevalent
in the tenant-house districts, creating, as usual, a vast amount of
sickness, and a large infant mortality. Very generally these diseases
were directly traceable to the decomposing filth, and in some instances
were stopped by the removal of the nuisance.

The Inspector of the Eighth Ward reports: "Cholera infantum has
probably consigned many more to the grave during the past summer than
all other diseases in my inspection district. In every case examined I
have found it associated with some well-marked course of insalubrity;
vegetable and animal decomposition have been the most prominent causes.
That fifty per cent die from preventable causes in my inspection
district I do not doubt."

The Inspector of the Sixth Ward says: "The mortality among children is
fearfully high, many families having lost all their children; others
four out of five or six."
Tenth Ward: The most prominent diseases during the past year have been
phthisis, typhoid and scarlet fevers, cholera infantum, dysentery,
smallpox, and diphtheria. They were most prevalent in the poorest part
of the district, having the lowest ground, the filthiest streets, and
the most dense population of poor and careless people, who are crowded
in the numerous tenant-houses, shanties, and small dwellings, which
were built for one or two families, but are now made to contain from
five to ten.

Nineteenth Ward: The diseases that have chiefly prevailed during the
past season are dysentery, diarrhoea, cholera morbus, cholera infantum
and the exanthematous fevers. They were of the most frequent occurrence
in the most crowded and insalubrious quarters.

Fifteenth Ward: Since the commencement of the survey, scarlet fever,
typhoid fever, smallpox, and cholera infantum have prevailed in the
tenant-houses of this ward. Six cases of smallpox occurred in one of
three thickly peopled rows of such dwellings, and the disease was
communicated to a child in an adjacent street, who had been playing in
the infected neighborhood. Seven cases of typhoid also occurred in a
court among children, and this was within a few doors of better class
houses.

Eleventh Ward: Typhus and typhoid fevers have been found prevailing
in all sections of this district. Smallpox, scarlatina, measles, and
pulmonary diseases are met with in almost every street. Typhus is the
most typical of the preventable diseases that abound in the Eleventh
Ward. Cholera infantum and obstinate diarrhoeal maladies were prevalent
in the rear tenements and throughout the lowest streets during the
summer and autumn.

To give you an idea of the wide prevalence of these diseases, I will
notice one or two more in detail.


[Sidenote: Smallpox]

Smallpox is the very type of preventable diseases. We have a safe
and sure preventive in thorough vaccination. And yet this loathsome
disease is at this moment an epidemic in New York. In two days' time,
the inspectors found 644 cases, and in two weeks, upward of 1,200;
and it was estimated that only about one-half were discovered. In
many large tenant-houses, six, eight, and ten cases were found at the
same time. They found it under every conceivable condition tending to
promote its communicability. It was in the street cars, in the stages,
in the hacks, on the ferry-boats, in junk-shops, in cigar-stores,
in candy-shops, in the families of tailors and seamstresses, who
were making clothing for wholesale stores, in public and in private
charities. I hold in my hand a list of cases of smallpox found
existing under circumstances which show how widespread is this disease.
Bedding of a fatal case of smallpox was sold to a rag-man; case in a
room where candy and daily papers were sold; case on a ferry-boat;
woman was attending bar and acting as nurse to her husband who had
smallpox; girl who was making cigars while scabs were falling from her
skin; seamstress who was making shirts for a Broadway store, one of
which was thrown over the cradle of a child sick of smallpox; tailors
making soldiers' clothing, have their children, from whom the scabs
were falling, wrapped in the garments; a woman selling vegetables had
the scabs falling from her face, among the vegetables, etc., etc.
Instances of this kind can be quoted at any length, but these examples
are sufficient to show that smallpox spreads uncontrolled throughout
our city. And they show, too, how this disease is disseminated abroad.
Says the Inspector of the Fourth Ward:


[Sidenote: Smallpox in Tailored Garments]

"In localities where smallpox prevailed I found, in some instances
within a few feet of the patients, tailors at work for our best
clothing establishments. Such infected vestments--worse than the tunic
of the Centaur--bring disease and death not only to the wearers, but
to many others. The occupant of the crowded tenant-house procures from
such a source a coat or a blanket, and soon a loathsome pest attacks
the young and unprotected members of his family, and ultimately spreads
through the entire quarter, destroying life after life and endangering
the health of a whole community.

"Smallpox, suddenly breaking out in some secluded rural district, often

are, perhaps, immediately afterward driven to the various car and
steamboat lines to secure passengers, who are thus exposed in the most
dangerous manner to these diseases."


[Sidenote: Typhus Fever]

Second only to smallpox as a preventable disease, but of a more fatal
character, is typhus fever. Typhus is greatly aggravated by domestic
filth, and by overcrowding, with deficient ventilation. The inspectors
found and located by street and number no less than 2,000 cases of this
most contagious and fatal disease. Commencing in a large tenant-house
in Mulberry Street, it was traced from locality to locality, in the
poorer quarters, until it was found to have visited nearly every
section of the city. It became localized in many tenant-houses and
streets, where it still remains, causing a large amount of sickness and
mortality.

At Mulberry Street, in a notoriously filthy house, it has existed
for more than four years. This house has a population of about 320,
which is renewed every few months. During the period alluded to, there
have been no less than 60 deaths by fever in this single house, and
240 cases. To-day this fever is raging uncontrolled in that house,
creating more orphans than many well-fought battles. Every new family
which enters these infected quarters is sure to fall a victim to this
pestilential disease.

[Illustration: PLAN OF FEVER-NEST, EAST 17TH STREET, 1865

_Here 85 Cases of Typhus Occurred in One Season_]

The tenant-house No. -- East Seventeenth Street, which reaks with
filth, gives the same history; upward of 85 cases, with a large
percentage of deaths, occurred in this single house during the past
season. And still it remained unclean and open to new tenants. I
could mention scores of these houses in every part of the tenant-house
district where typhus has apparently taken up its abode, and from
whence it sends out in every direction its deadly streams.

Not only have single houses become centres of contagion, but this
fever has, in many instances, become localized in crowded streets,
which to-day are almost impassable on account of the heaps of garbage,
and the courts and alleys of which are reeking with filth, making
them great centres of pestilence. From many of these tenements whole
families have been swept away.

[Illustration: BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF FEVER-NEST, 1865, NOT FAR FROM
BROADWAY AND FIFTH AVENUE]

Jersey Street, a short but uncleaned avenue, adjacent to a fashionable
part of Broadway, is another great depot of fever, which, according to
these records, frequently contained upward of thirty cases in progress
at one time. East Eleventh Street, between First and Second Avenues,
now, as all the past summer, in a horribly filthy condition, is a
local habitation of fever of the worst type. The same statement may be
made of nearly every district where the tenant-houses are especially
crowded, and the streets, courts, and alleys are unusually filthy.


[Sidenote: Intestinal Affections]

Intestinal diseases, as cholera infantum, diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid
fever, etc., which arise from, or are intensely aggravated by the
emanations from putrescible material in streets, courts, and alleys,
or from cesspools, privies, drain pipes, sewers, etc., were prevalent
in the tenant-house districts, creating, as usual, a vast amount of
sickness, and a large infant mortality. Very generally these diseases
were directly traceable to the decomposing filth, and in some instances
were stopped by the removal of the nuisance.

The Inspector of the Eighth Ward reports: "Cholera infantum has
probably consigned many more to the grave during the past summer than
all other diseases in my inspection district. In every case examined I
have found it associated with some well-marked course of insalubrity;
vegetable and animal decomposition have been the most prominent causes.
That fifty per cent die from preventable causes in my inspection
district I do not doubt."

The Inspector of the Sixth Ward says: "The mortality among children is
fearfully high, many families having lost all their children; others
four out of five or six."
Tenth Ward: The most prominent diseases during the past year have been
phthisis, typhoid and scarlet fevers, cholera infantum, dysentery,
smallpox, and diphtheria. They were most prevalent in the poorest part
of the district, having the lowest ground, the filthiest streets, and
the most dense population of poor and careless people, who are crowded
in the numerous tenant-houses, shanties, and small dwellings, which
were built for one or two families, but are now made to contain from
five to ten.

Nineteenth Ward: The diseases that have chiefly prevailed during the
past season are dysentery, diarrhoea, cholera morbus, cholera infantum
and the exanthematous fevers. They were of the most frequent occurrence
in the most crowded and insalubrious quarters.

Fifteenth Ward: Since the commencement of the survey, scarlet fever,
typhoid fever, smallpox, and cholera infantum have prevailed in the
tenant-houses of this ward. Six cases of smallpox occurred in one of
three thickly peopled rows of such dwellings, and the disease was
communicated to a child in an adjacent street, who had been playing in
the infected neighborhood. Seven cases of typhoid also occurred in a
court among children, and this was within a few doors of better class
houses.

Eleventh Ward: Typhus and typhoid fevers have been found prevailing
in all sections of this district. Smallpox, scarlatina, measles, and
pulmonary diseases are met with in almost every street. Typhus is the
most typical of the preventable diseases that abound in the Eleventh
Ward. Cholera infantum and obstinate diarrhoeal maladies were prevalent
in the rear tenements and throughout the lowest streets during the
summer and autumn.

To give you an idea of the wide prevalence of these diseases, I will
notice one or two more in detail.


[Sidenote: Smallpox]

Smallpox is the very type of preventable diseases. We have a safe
and sure preventive in thorough vaccination. And yet this loathsome
disease is at this moment an epidemic in New York. In two days' time,
the inspectors found 644 cases, and in two weeks, upward of 1,200;
and it was estimated that only about one-half were discovered. In
many large tenant-houses, six, eight, and ten cases were found at the
same time. They found it under every conceivable condition tending to
promote its communicability. It was in the street cars, in the stages,
in the hacks, on the ferry-boats, in junk-shops, in cigar-stores,
in candy-shops, in the families of tailors and seamstresses, who
were making clothing for wholesale stores, in public and in private
charities. I hold in my hand a list of cases of smallpox found
existing under circumstances which show how widespread is this disease.
Bedding of a fatal case of smallpox was sold to a rag-man; case in a
room where candy and daily papers were sold; case on a ferry-boat;
woman was attending bar and acting as nurse to her husband who had
smallpox; girl who was making cigars while scabs were falling from her
skin; seamstress who was making shirts for a Broadway store, one of
which was thrown over the cradle of a child sick of smallpox; tailors
making soldiers' clothing, have their children, from whom the scabs
were falling, wrapped in the garments; a woman selling vegetables had
the scabs falling from her face, among the vegetables, etc., etc.
Instances of this kind can be quoted at any length, but these examples
are sufficient to show that smallpox spreads uncontrolled throughout
our city. And they show, too, how this disease is disseminated abroad.
Says the Inspector of the Fourth Ward:


[Sidenote: Smallpox in Tailored Garments]

"In localities where smallpox prevailed I found, in some instances
within a few feet of the patients, tailors at work for our best
clothing establishments. Such infected vestments--worse than the tunic
of the Centaur--bring disease and death not only to the wearers, but
to many others. The occupant of the crowded tenant-house procures from
such a source a coat or a blanket, and soon a loathsome pest attacks
the young and unprotected members of his family, and ultimately spreads
through the entire quarter, destroying life after life and endangering
the health of a whole community.

"Smallpox, suddenly breaking out in some secluded rural district, often
owes its unsuspected origin to the above causes. In the remote solitude
of the ocean the seaman opens the chest in which he has deposited such
obnoxious apparel, and from this Pandora's box scatters the seeds of
pestilence among his comrades, which, ripening, shall spread its germs
to distant ports."

Or, what is more striking, take the following from the report of the
Inspector of the Fifth Ward:

"The largest wholesale establishments for the sale of dry goods
on this side of the Atlantic Ocean are in immediate contact with
the tenant-houses of the worst class, and which are infested with
smallpox and typhus fever. The two freight depots and the principal
passenger depot of the Railroad Company are in the same close
association with these nests of infection. In the region immediately
surrounding are also situated several hotels, and a large number of
boarding-houses, whose inmates are thus in danger of personal contact
with these diseases any moment. West Broadway, running through the
very centre of the district, is traversed by five different lines of
railway cars, with an average of five cars passing every minute, and
carrying millions of passengers yearly by the very doors of these
houses. Broadway, at but a short distance removed, is the principal
thoroughfare of the city. Hudson Street on the west is also a leading
route for city travel; and the cross streets of the district are
traversed daily by multitudes to reach various lines of steamboats,
cars, and steamships, which leave the city opposite this point.

[Illustration: A REGION OF SMALLPOX AND TYPHUS FEVER, 1865]

"All this large amount of daily travel passes through a region always
containing cases of typhus fever, and largely infected with smallpox.
Is it any cause of surprise that cases of these diseases are here
contracted, to be carried to distant sections of the country, there to
develop themselves, to the surprise and alarm of whole neighborhoods?
It is also well to remember that several large livery stables
are located in the immediate neighborhood, whose vehicles, it is
well-known, are frequently employed to carry persons, suffering from
these diseases, to hospitals, or to attend at funerals. These vehicles
are, perhaps, immediately afterward driven to the various car and
steamboat lines to secure passengers, who are thus exposed in the most
dangerous manner to these diseases."

[Illustration: BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF FEVER-NEST, 1865, NOT FAR FROM
BROADWAY AND FIFTH AVENUE]

Jersey Street, a short but uncleaned avenue, adjacent to a fashionable
part of Broadway, is another great depot of fever, which, according to
these records, frequently contained upward of thirty cases in progress
at one time. East Eleventh Street, between First and Second Avenues,
now, as all the past summer, in a horribly filthy condition, is a
local habitation of fever of the worst type. The same statement may be
made of nearly every district where the tenant-houses are especially
crowded, and the streets, courts, and alleys are unusually filthy.


[Sidenote: Intestinal Affections]

Intestinal diseases, as cholera infantum, diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid
fever, etc., which arise from, or are intensely aggravated by the
emanations from putrescible material in streets, courts, and alleys,
or from cesspools, privies, drain pipes, sewers, etc., were prevalent
in the tenant-house districts, creating, as usual, a vast amount of
sickness, and a large infant mortality. Very generally these diseases
were directly traceable to the decomposing filth, and in some instances
were stopped by the removal of the nuisance.

The Inspector of the Eighth Ward reports: "Cholera infantum has
probably consigned many more to the grave during the past summer than
all other diseases in my inspection district. In every case examined I
have found it associated with some well-marked course of insalubrity;
vegetable and animal decomposition have been the most prominent causes.
That fifty per cent die from preventable causes in my inspection
district I do not doubt."

The Inspector of the Sixth Ward says: "The mortality among children is
fearfully high, many families having lost all their children; others
four out of five or six."
Tenth Ward: The most prominent diseases during the past year have been
phthisis, typhoid and scarlet fevers, cholera infantum, dysentery,
smallpox, and diphtheria. They were most prevalent in the poorest part
of the district, having the lowest ground, the filthiest streets, and
the most dense population of poor and careless people, who are crowded
in the numerous tenant-houses, shanties, and small dwellings, which
were built for one or two families, but are now made to contain from
five to ten.

Nineteenth Ward: The diseases that have chiefly prevailed during the
past season are dysentery, diarrhoea, cholera morbus, cholera infantum
and the exanthematous fevers. They were of the most frequent occurrence
in the most crowded and insalubrious quarters.

Fifteenth Ward: Since the commencement of the survey, scarlet fever,
typhoid fever, smallpox, and cholera infantum have prevailed in the
tenant-houses of this ward. Six cases of smallpox occurred in one of
three thickly peopled rows of such dwellings, and the disease was
communicated to a child in an adjacent street, who had been playing in
the infected neighborhood. Seven cases of typhoid also occurred in a
court among children, and this was within a few doors of better class
houses.

Eleventh Ward: Typhus and typhoid fevers have been found prevailing
in all sections of this district. Smallpox, scarlatina, measles, and
pulmonary diseases are met with in almost every street. Typhus is the
most typical of the preventable diseases that abound in the Eleventh
Ward. Cholera infantum and obstinate diarrhoeal maladies were prevalent
in the rear tenements and throughout the lowest streets during the
summer and autumn.

To give you an idea of the wide prevalence of these diseases, I will
notice one or two more in detail.


[Sidenote: Smallpox]

Smallpox is the very type of preventable diseases. We have a safe
and sure preventive in thorough vaccination. And yet this loathsome
disease is at this moment an epidemic in New York. In two days' time,
the inspectors found 644 cases, and in two weeks, upward of 1,200;
and it was estimated that only about one-half were discovered. In
many large tenant-houses, six, eight, and ten cases were found at the
same time. They found it under every conceivable condition tending to
promote its communicability. It was in the street cars, in the stages,
in the hacks, on the ferry-boats, in junk-shops, in cigar-stores,
in candy-shops, in the families of tailors and seamstresses, who
were making clothing for wholesale stores, in public and in private
charities. I hold in my hand a list of cases of smallpox found
existing under circumstances which show how widespread is this disease.
Bedding of a fatal case of smallpox was sold to a rag-man; case in a
room where candy and daily papers were sold; case on a ferry-boat;
woman was attending bar and acting as nurse to her husband who had
smallpox; girl who was making cigars while scabs were falling from her
skin; seamstress who was making shirts for a Broadway store, one of
which was thrown over the cradle of a child sick of smallpox; tailors
making soldiers' clothing, have their children, from whom the scabs
were falling, wrapped in the garments; a woman selling vegetables had
the scabs falling from her face, among the vegetables, etc., etc.
Instances of this kind can be quoted at any length, but these examples
are sufficient to show that smallpox spreads uncontrolled throughout
our city. And they show, too, how this disease is disseminated abroad.
Says the Inspector of the Fourth Ward:


[Sidenote: Smallpox in Tailored Garments]

"In localities where smallpox prevailed I found, in some instances
within a few feet of the patients, tailors at work for our best
clothing establishments. Such infected vestments--worse than the tunic
of the Centaur--bring disease and death not only to the wearers, but
to many others. The occupant of the crowded tenant-house procures from
such a source a coat or a blanket, and soon a loathsome pest attacks
the young and unprotected members of his family, and ultimately spreads
through the entire quarter, destroying life after life and endangering
the health of a whole community.

"Smallpox, suddenly breaking out in some secluded rural district, often
owes its unsuspected origin to the above causes. In the remote solitude
of the ocean the seaman opens the chest in which he has deposited such
obnoxious apparel, and from this Pandora's box scatters the seeds of
pestilence among his comrades, which, ripening, shall spread its germs
to distant ports."

Or, what is more striking, take the following from the report of the
Inspector of the Fifth Ward:

"The largest wholesale establishments for the sale of dry goods
on this side of the Atlantic Ocean are in immediate contact with
the tenant-houses of the worst class, and which are infested with
smallpox and typhus fever. The two freight depots and the principal
passenger depot of the Railroad Company are in the same close
association with these nests of infection. In the region immediately
surrounding are also situated several hotels, and a large number of
boarding-houses, whose inmates are thus in danger of personal contact
with these diseases any moment. West Broadway, running through the
very centre of the district, is traversed by five different lines of
railway cars, with an average of five cars passing every minute, and
carrying millions of passengers yearly by the very doors of these
houses. Broadway, at but a short distance removed, is the principal
thoroughfare of the city. Hudson Street on the west is also a leading
route for city travel; and the cross streets of the district are
traversed daily by multitudes to reach various lines of steamboats,
cars, and steamships, which leave the city opposite this point.

[Illustration: A REGION OF SMALLPOX AND TYPHUS FEVER, 1865]

"All this large amount of daily travel passes through a region always
containing cases of typhus fever, and largely infected with smallpox.
Is it any cause of surprise that cases of these diseases are here
contracted, to be carried to distant sections of the country, there to
develop themselves, to the surprise and alarm of whole neighborhoods?
It is also well to remember that several large livery stables
are located in the immediate neighborhood, whose vehicles, it is
well-known, are frequently employed to carry persons, suffering from
these diseases, to hospitals, or to attend at funerals. These vehicles
are, perhaps, immediately afterward driven to the various car and
steamboat lines to secure passengers, who are thus exposed in the most
dangerous manner to these diseases."


[Sidenote: Typhus Fever]

Second only to smallpox as a preventable disease, but of a more fatal
character, is typhus fever. Typhus is greatly aggravated by domestic
filth, and by overcrowding, with deficient ventilation. The inspectors
found and located by street and number no less than 2,000 cases of this
most contagious and fatal disease. Commencing in a large tenant-house
in Mulberry Street, it was traced from locality to locality, in the
poorer quarters, until it was found to have visited nearly every
section of the city. It became localized in many tenant-houses and
streets, where it still remains, causing a large amount of sickness and
mortality.

At Mulberry Street, in a notoriously filthy house, it has existed
for more than four years. This house has a population of about 320,
which is renewed every few months. During the period alluded to, there
have been no less than 60 deaths by fever in this single house, and
240 cases. To-day this fever is raging uncontrolled in that house,
creating more orphans than many well-fought battles. Every new family
which enters these infected quarters is sure to fall a victim to this
pestilential disease.

[Illustration: PLAN OF FEVER-NEST, EAST 17TH STREET, 1865

_Here 85 Cases of Typhus Occurred in One Season_]

The tenant-house No. -- East Seventeenth Street, which reaks with
filth, gives the same history; upward of 85 cases, with a large
percentage of deaths, occurred in this single house during the past
season. And still it remained unclean and open to new tenants. I
could mention scores of these houses in every part of the tenant-house
district where typhus has apparently taken up its abode, and from
whence it sends out in every direction its deadly streams.

Not only have single houses become centres of contagion, but this
fever has, in many instances, become localized in crowded streets,
which to-day are almost impassable on account of the heaps of garbage,
and the courts and alleys of which are reeking with filth, making
them great centres of pestilence. From many of these tenements whole
families have been swept away.

and the exanthematous fevers. They were of the most frequent occurrence
in the most crowded and insalubrious quarters.

Fifteenth Ward: Since the commencement of the survey, scarlet fever,
typhoid fever, smallpox, and cholera infantum have prevailed in the
tenant-houses of this ward. Six cases of smallpox occurred in one of
three thickly peopled rows of such dwellings, and the disease was
communicated to a child in an adjacent street, who had been playing in
the infected neighborhood. Seven cases of typhoid also occurred in a
court among children, and this was within a few doors of better class
houses.

Eleventh Ward: Typhus and typhoid fevers have been found prevailing
in all sections of this district. Smallpox, scarlatina, measles, and
pulmonary diseases are met with in almost every street. Typhus is the
most typical of the preventable diseases that abound in the Eleventh
Ward. Cholera infantum and obstinate diarrhoeal maladies were prevalent
in the rear tenements and throughout the lowest streets during the
summer and autumn.

To give you an idea of the wide prevalence of these diseases, I will
notice one or two more in detail.


[Sidenote: Smallpox]

Smallpox is the very type of preventable diseases. We have a safe
and sure preventive in thorough vaccination. And yet this loathsome
disease is at this moment an epidemic in New York. In two days' time,
the inspectors found 644 cases, and in two weeks, upward of 1,200;
and it was estimated that only about one-half were discovered. In
many large tenant-houses, six, eight, and ten cases were found at the
same time. They found it under every conceivable condition tending to
promote its communicability. It was in the street cars, in the stages,
in the hacks, on the ferry-boats, in junk-shops, in cigar-stores,
in candy-shops, in the families of tailors and seamstresses, who
were making clothing for wholesale stores, in public and in private
charities. I hold in my hand a list of cases of smallpox found
existing under circumstances which show how widespread is this disease.
Bedding of a fatal case of smallpox was sold to a rag-man; case in a
room where candy and daily papers were sold; case on a ferry-boat;
woman was attending bar and acting as nurse to her husband who had
smallpox; girl who was making cigars while scabs were falling from her
skin; seamstress who was making shirts for a Broadway store, one of
which was thrown over the cradle of a child sick of smallpox; tailors
making soldiers' clothing, have their children, from whom the scabs
were falling, wrapped in the garments; a woman selling vegetables had
the scabs falling from her face, among the vegetables, etc., etc.
Instances of this kind can be quoted at any length, but these examples
are sufficient to show that smallpox spreads uncontrolled throughout
our city. And they show, too, how this disease is disseminated abroad.
Says the Inspector of the Fourth Ward:


[Sidenote: Smallpox in Tailored Garments]

"In localities where smallpox prevailed I found, in some instances
within a few feet of the patients, tailors at work for our best
clothing establishments. Such infected vestments--worse than the tunic
of the Centaur--bring disease and death not only to the wearers, but
to many others. The occupant of the crowded tenant-house procures from
such a source a coat or a blanket, and soon a loathsome pest attacks
the young and unprotected members of his family, and ultimately spreads
through the entire quarter, destroying life after life and endangering
the health of a whole community.

"Smallpox, suddenly breaking out in some secluded rural district, often
owes its unsuspected origin to the above causes. In the remote solitude
of the ocean the seaman opens the chest in which he has deposited such
obnoxious apparel, and from this Pandora's box scatters the seeds of
pestilence among his comrades, which, ripening, shall spread its germs
to distant ports."

Or, what is more striking, take the following from the report of the
Inspector of the Fifth Ward:

"The largest wholesale establishments for the sale of dry goods
on this side of the Atlantic Ocean are in immediate contact with
the tenant-houses of the worst class, and which are infested with
smallpox and typhus fever. The two freight depots and the principal
passenger depot of the Railroad Company are in the same close
association with these nests of infection. In the region immediately
surrounding are also situated several hotels, and a large number of
boarding-houses, whose inmates are thus in danger of personal contact
with these diseases any moment. West Broadway, running through the
very centre of the district, is traversed by five different lines of
railway cars, with an average of five cars passing every minute, and
carrying millions of passengers yearly by the very doors of these
houses. Broadway, at but a short distance removed, is the principal
thoroughfare of the city. Hudson Street on the west is also a leading
route for city travel; and the cross streets of the district are
traversed daily by multitudes to reach various lines of steamboats,
cars, and steamships, which leave the city opposite this point.

[Illustration: A REGION OF SMALLPOX AND TYPHUS FEVER, 1865]

"All this large amount of daily travel passes through a region always
containing cases of typhus fever, and largely infected with smallpox.
Is it any cause of surprise that cases of these diseases are here
contracted, to be carried to distant sections of the country, there to
develop themselves, to the surprise and alarm of whole neighborhoods?
It is also well to remember that several large livery stables
are located in the immediate neighborhood, whose vehicles, it is
well-known, are frequently employed to carry persons, suffering from
these diseases, to hospitals, or to attend at funerals. These vehicles
are, perhaps, immediately afterward driven to the various car and
steamboat lines to secure passengers, who are thus exposed in the most
dangerous manner to these diseases."


[Sidenote: Typhus Fever]

Second only to smallpox as a preventable disease, but of a more fatal
character, is typhus fever. Typhus is greatly aggravated by domestic
filth, and by overcrowding, with deficient ventilation. The inspectors
found and located by street and number no less than 2,000 cases of this
most contagious and fatal disease. Commencing in a large tenant-house
in Mulberry Street, it was traced from locality to locality, in the
poorer quarters, until it was found to have visited nearly every
section of the city. It became localized in many tenant-houses and
streets, where it still remains, causing a large amount of sickness and
mortality.

At Mulberry Street, in a notoriously filthy house, it has existed
for more than four years. This house has a population of about 320,
which is renewed every few months. During the period alluded to, there
have been no less than 60 deaths by fever in this single house, and
240 cases. To-day this fever is raging uncontrolled in that house,
creating more orphans than many well-fought battles. Every new family
which enters these infected quarters is sure to fall a victim to this
pestilential disease.

[Illustration: PLAN OF FEVER-NEST, EAST 17TH STREET, 1865

_Here 85 Cases of Typhus Occurred in One Season_]

The tenant-house No. -- East Seventeenth Street, which reaks with
filth, gives the same history; upward of 85 cases, with a large
percentage of deaths, occurred in this single house during the past
season. And still it remained unclean and open to new tenants. I
could mention scores of these houses in every part of the tenant-house
district where typhus has apparently taken up its abode, and from
whence it sends out in every direction its deadly streams.

Not only have single houses become centres of contagion, but this
fever has, in many instances, become localized in crowded streets,
which to-day are almost impassable on account of the heaps of garbage,
and the courts and alleys of which are reeking with filth, making
them great centres of pestilence. From many of these tenements whole
families have been swept away.

[Illustration: BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF FEVER-NEST, 1865, NOT FAR FROM
BROADWAY AND FIFTH AVENUE]

Jersey Street, a short but uncleaned avenue, adjacent to a fashionable
part of Broadway, is another great depot of fever, which, according to
these records, frequently contained upward of thirty cases in progress
at one time. East Eleventh Street, between First and Second Avenues,
now, as all the past summer, in a horribly filthy condition, is a
local habitation of fever of the worst type. The same statement may be
made of nearly every district where the tenant-houses are especially
crowded, and the streets, courts, and alleys are unusually filthy.


[Sidenote: Intestinal Affections]

Intestinal diseases, as cholera infantum, diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid
fever, etc., which arise from, or are intensely aggravated by the
emanations from putrescible material in streets, courts, and alleys,
or from cesspools, privies, drain pipes, sewers, etc., were prevalent
in the tenant-house districts, creating, as usual, a vast amount of
sickness, and a large infant mortality. Very generally these diseases
were directly traceable to the decomposing filth, and in some instances
were stopped by the removal of the nuisance.

The Inspector of the Eighth Ward reports: "Cholera infantum has
probably consigned many more to the grave during the past summer than
all other diseases in my inspection district. In every case examined I
have found it associated with some well-marked course of insalubrity;
vegetable and animal decomposition have been the most prominent causes.
That fifty per cent die from preventable causes in my inspection
district I do not doubt."

The Inspector of the Sixth Ward says: "The mortality among children is
fearfully high, many families having lost all their children; others
four out of five or six."
Tenth Ward: The most prominent diseases during the past year have been
phthisis, typhoid and scarlet fevers, cholera infantum, dysentery,
smallpox, and diphtheria. They were most prevalent in the poorest part
of the district, having the lowest ground, the filthiest streets, and
the most dense population of poor and careless people, who are crowded
in the numerous tenant-houses, shanties, and small dwellings, which
were built for one or two families, but are now made to contain from
five to ten.

Nineteenth Ward: The diseases that have chiefly prevailed during the
past season are dysentery, diarrhoea, cholera morbus, cholera infantum
and the exanthematous fevers. They were of the most frequent occurrence
in the most crowded and insalubrious quarters.

skin; seamstress who was making shirts for a Broadway store, one of
which was thrown over the cradle of a child sick of smallpox; tailors
making soldiers' clothing, have their children, from whom the scabs
were falling, wrapped in the garments; a woman selling vegetables had
the scabs falling from her face, among the vegetables, etc., etc.
Instances of this kind can be quoted at any length, but these examples
are sufficient to show that smallpox spreads uncontrolled throughout
our city. And they show, too, how this disease is disseminated abroad.
Says the Inspector of the Fourth Ward:


[Sidenote: Smallpox in Tailored Garments]

"In localities where smallpox prevailed I found, in some instances
within a few feet of the patients, tailors at work for our best
clothing establishments. Such infected vestments--worse than the tunic
of the Centaur--bring disease and death not only to the wearers, but
to many others. The occupant of the crowded tenant-house procures from
such a source a coat or a blanket, and soon a loathsome pest attacks
the young and unprotected members of his family, and ultimately spreads
through the entire quarter, destroying life after life and endangering
the health of a whole community.

"Smallpox, suddenly breaking out in some secluded rural district, often
owes its unsuspected origin to the above causes. In the remote solitude
of the ocean the seaman opens the chest in which he has deposited such
obnoxious apparel, and from this Pandora's box scatters the seeds of
pestilence among his comrades, which, ripening, shall spread its germs
to distant ports."

Or, what is more striking, take the following from the report of the
Inspector of the Fifth Ward:

"The largest wholesale establishments for the sale of dry goods
on this side of the Atlantic Ocean are in immediate contact with
the tenant-houses of the worst class, and which are infested with
smallpox and typhus fever. The two freight depots and the principal
passenger depot of the Railroad Company are in the same close
association with these nests of infection. In the region immediately
surrounding are also situated several hotels, and a large number of
boarding-houses, whose inmates are thus in danger of personal contact
with these diseases any moment. West Broadway, running through the
very centre of the district, is traversed by five different lines of
railway cars, with an average of five cars passing every minute, and
carrying millions of passengers yearly by the very doors of these
houses. Broadway, at but a short distance removed, is the principal
thoroughfare of the city. Hudson Street on the west is also a leading
route for city travel; and the cross streets of the district are
traversed daily by multitudes to reach various lines of steamboats,
cars, and steamships, which leave the city opposite this point.

[Illustration: A REGION OF SMALLPOX AND TYPHUS FEVER, 1865]

"All this large amount of daily travel passes through a region always
containing cases of typhus fever, and largely infected with smallpox.
Is it any cause of surprise that cases of these diseases are here
contracted, to be carried to distant sections of the country, there to
develop themselves, to the surprise and alarm of whole neighborhoods?
It is also well to remember that several large livery stables
are located in the immediate neighborhood, whose vehicles, it is
well-known, are frequently employed to carry persons, suffering from
these diseases, to hospitals, or to attend at funerals. These vehicles
are, perhaps, immediately afterward driven to the various car and
steamboat lines to secure passengers, who are thus exposed in the most
dangerous manner to these diseases."


[Sidenote: Typhus Fever]

Second only to smallpox as a preventable disease, but of a more fatal
character, is typhus fever. Typhus is greatly aggravated by domestic
filth, and by overcrowding, with deficient ventilation. The inspectors
found and located by street and number no less than 2,000 cases of this
most contagious and fatal disease. Commencing in a large tenant-house
in Mulberry Street, it was traced from locality to locality, in the
poorer quarters, until it was found to have visited nearly every
section of the city. It became localized in many tenant-houses and
streets, where it still remains, causing a large amount of sickness and
mortality.

At Mulberry Street, in a notoriously filthy house, it has existed
for more than four years. This house has a population of about 320,
which is renewed every few months. During the period alluded to, there
have been no less than 60 deaths by fever in this single house, and
240 cases. To-day this fever is raging uncontrolled in that house,
creating more orphans than many well-fought battles. Every new family
which enters these infected quarters is sure to fall a victim to this
pestilential disease.

[Illustration: PLAN OF FEVER-NEST, EAST 17TH STREET, 1865

_Here 85 Cases of Typhus Occurred in One Season_]

The tenant-house No. -- East Seventeenth Street, which reaks with
filth, gives the same history; upward of 85 cases, with a large
percentage of deaths, occurred in this single house during the past
season. And still it remained unclean and open to new tenants. I
could mention scores of these houses in every part of the tenant-house
district where typhus has apparently taken up its abode, and from
whence it sends out in every direction its deadly streams.

Not only have single houses become centres of contagion, but this
fever has, in many instances, become localized in crowded streets,
which to-day are almost impassable on account of the heaps of garbage,
and the courts and alleys of which are reeking with filth, making
them great centres of pestilence. From many of these tenements whole
families have been swept away.

[Illustration: BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF FEVER-NEST, 1865, NOT FAR FROM
BROADWAY AND FIFTH AVENUE]

Jersey Street, a short but uncleaned avenue, adjacent to a fashionable
part of Broadway, is another great depot of fever, which, according to
these records, frequently contained upward of thirty cases in progress
at one time. East Eleventh Street, between First and Second Avenues,
now, as all the past summer, in a horribly filthy condition, is a
local habitation of fever of the worst type. The same statement may be
made of nearly every district where the tenant-houses are especially
crowded, and the streets, courts, and alleys are unusually filthy.


[Sidenote: Intestinal Affections]

Intestinal diseases, as cholera infantum, diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid
fever, etc., which arise from, or are intensely aggravated by the
emanations from putrescible material in streets, courts, and alleys,
or from cesspools, privies, drain pipes, sewers, etc., were prevalent
in the tenant-house districts, creating, as usual, a vast amount of
sickness, and a large infant mortality. Very generally these diseases
were directly traceable to the decomposing filth, and in some instances
were stopped by the removal of the nuisance.

The Inspector of the Eighth Ward reports: "Cholera infantum has
probably consigned many more to the grave during the past summer than
all other diseases in my inspection district. In every case examined I
have found it associated with some well-marked course of insalubrity;
vegetable and animal decomposition have been the most prominent causes.
That fifty per cent die from preventable causes in my inspection
district I do not doubt."

The Inspector of the Sixth Ward says: "The mortality among children is
fearfully high, many families having lost all their children; others
four out of five or six."
Tenth Ward: The most prominent diseases during the past year have been
phthisis, typhoid and scarlet fevers, cholera infantum, dysentery,
smallpox, and diphtheria. They were most prevalent in the poorest part
of the district, having the lowest ground, the filthiest streets, and
the most dense population of poor and careless people, who are crowded
in the numerous tenant-houses, shanties, and small dwellings, which
were built for one or two families, but are now made to contain from
five to ten.

Nineteenth Ward: The diseases that have chiefly prevailed during the
past season are dysentery, diarrhoea, cholera morbus, cholera infantum
and the exanthematous fevers. They were of the most frequent occurrence
in the most crowded and insalubrious quarters.

Fifteenth Ward: Since the commencement of the survey, scarlet fever,
typhoid fever, smallpox, and cholera infantum have prevailed in the
tenant-houses of this ward. Six cases of smallpox occurred in one of
three thickly peopled rows of such dwellings, and the disease was
communicated to a child in an adjacent street, who had been playing in
the infected neighborhood. Seven cases of typhoid also occurred in a
court among children, and this was within a few doors of better class
houses.

Eleventh Ward: Typhus and typhoid fevers have been found prevailing
in all sections of this district. Smallpox, scarlatina, measles, and
pulmonary diseases are met with in almost every street. Typhus is the
most typical of the preventable diseases that abound in the Eleventh
Ward. Cholera infantum and obstinate diarrhoeal maladies were prevalent
in the rear tenements and throughout the lowest streets during the
summer and autumn.

To give you an idea of the wide prevalence of these diseases, I will
notice one or two more in detail.


[Sidenote: Smallpox]

Smallpox is the very type of preventable diseases. We have a safe
and sure preventive in thorough vaccination. And yet this loathsome
disease is at this moment an epidemic in New York. In two days' time,
the inspectors found 644 cases, and in two weeks, upward of 1,200;
and it was estimated that only about one-half were discovered. In
many large tenant-houses, six, eight, and ten cases were found at the
same time. They found it under every conceivable condition tending to
promote its communicability. It was in the street cars, in the stages,
in the hacks, on the ferry-boats, in junk-shops, in cigar-stores,
in candy-shops, in the families of tailors and seamstresses, who
were making clothing for wholesale stores, in public and in private
charities. I hold in my hand a list of cases of smallpox found
existing under circumstances which show how widespread is this disease.
Bedding of a fatal case of smallpox was sold to a rag-man; case in a
room where candy and daily papers were sold; case on a ferry-boat;
woman was attending bar and acting as nurse to her husband who had
smallpox; girl who was making cigars while scabs were falling from her
skin; seamstress who was making shirts for a Broadway store, one of
which was thrown over the cradle of a child sick of smallpox; tailors
making soldiers' clothing, have their children, from whom the scabs
were falling, wrapped in the garments; a woman selling vegetables had
the scabs falling from her face, among the vegetables, etc., etc.

houses. Broadway, at but a short distance removed, is the principal
thoroughfare of the city. Hudson Street on the west is also a leading
route for city travel; and the cross streets of the district are
traversed daily by multitudes to reach various lines of steamboats,
cars, and steamships, which leave the city opposite this point.

[Illustration: A REGION OF SMALLPOX AND TYPHUS FEVER, 1865]

"All this large amount of daily travel passes through a region always
containing cases of typhus fever, and largely infected with smallpox.
Is it any cause of surprise that cases of these diseases are here
contracted, to be carried to distant sections of the country, there to
develop themselves, to the surprise and alarm of whole neighborhoods?
It is also well to remember that several large livery stables
are located in the immediate neighborhood, whose vehicles, it is
well-known, are frequently employed to carry persons, suffering from
these diseases, to hospitals, or to attend at funerals. These vehicles
are, perhaps, immediately afterward driven to the various car and
steamboat lines to secure passengers, who are thus exposed in the most
dangerous manner to these diseases."


[Sidenote: Typhus Fever]

Second only to smallpox as a preventable disease, but of a more fatal
character, is typhus fever. Typhus is greatly aggravated by domestic
filth, and by overcrowding, with deficient ventilation. The inspectors
found and located by street and number no less than 2,000 cases of this
most contagious and fatal disease. Commencing in a large tenant-house
in Mulberry Street, it was traced from locality to locality, in the
poorer quarters, until it was found to have visited nearly every
section of the city. It became localized in many tenant-houses and
streets, where it still remains, causing a large amount of sickness and
mortality.

At Mulberry Street, in a notoriously filthy house, it has existed
for more than four years. This house has a population of about 320,
which is renewed every few months. During the period alluded to, there
have been no less than 60 deaths by fever in this single house, and
240 cases. To-day this fever is raging uncontrolled in that house,
creating more orphans than many well-fought battles. Every new family
which enters these infected quarters is sure to fall a victim to this
pestilential disease.

[Illustration: PLAN OF FEVER-NEST, EAST 17TH STREET, 1865

_Here 85 Cases of Typhus Occurred in One Season_]

The tenant-house No. -- East Seventeenth Street, which reaks with
filth, gives the same history; upward of 85 cases, with a large
percentage of deaths, occurred in this single house during the past
season. And still it remained unclean and open to new tenants. I
could mention scores of these houses in every part of the tenant-house
district where typhus has apparently taken up its abode, and from
whence it sends out in every direction its deadly streams.

Not only have single houses become centres of contagion, but this
fever has, in many instances, become localized in crowded streets,
which to-day are almost impassable on account of the heaps of garbage,
and the courts and alleys of which are reeking with filth, making
them great centres of pestilence. From many of these tenements whole
families have been swept away.

[Illustration: BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF FEVER-NEST, 1865, NOT FAR FROM
BROADWAY AND FIFTH AVENUE]

Jersey Street, a short but uncleaned avenue, adjacent to a fashionable
part of Broadway, is another great depot of fever, which, according to
these records, frequently contained upward of thirty cases in progress
at one time. East Eleventh Street, between First and Second Avenues,
now, as all the past summer, in a horribly filthy condition, is a
local habitation of fever of the worst type. The same statement may be
made of nearly every district where the tenant-houses are especially
crowded, and the streets, courts, and alleys are unusually filthy.


[Sidenote: Intestinal Affections]

Intestinal diseases, as cholera infantum, diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid
fever, etc., which arise from, or are intensely aggravated by the
emanations from putrescible material in streets, courts, and alleys,
or from cesspools, privies, drain pipes, sewers, etc., were prevalent
in the tenant-house districts, creating, as usual, a vast amount of
sickness, and a large infant mortality. Very generally these diseases
were directly traceable to the decomposing filth, and in some instances
were stopped by the removal of the nuisance.

The Inspector of the Eighth Ward reports: "Cholera infantum has
probably consigned many more to the grave during the past summer than
all other diseases in my inspection district. In every case examined I
have found it associated with some well-marked course of insalubrity;
vegetable and animal decomposition have been the most prominent causes.
That fifty per cent die from preventable causes in my inspection
district I do not doubt."

The Inspector of the Sixth Ward says: "The mortality among children is
fearfully high, many families having lost all their children; others
four out of five or six."
Tenth Ward: The most prominent diseases during the past year have been
phthisis, typhoid and scarlet fevers, cholera infantum, dysentery,
smallpox, and diphtheria. They were most prevalent in the poorest part
of the district, having the lowest ground, the filthiest streets, and
the most dense population of poor and careless people, who are crowded
in the numerous tenant-houses, shanties, and small dwellings, which
were built for one or two families, but are now made to contain from
five to ten.

Nineteenth Ward: The diseases that have chiefly prevailed during the
past season are dysentery, diarrhoea, cholera morbus, cholera infantum
and the exanthematous fevers. They were of the most frequent occurrence
in the most crowded and insalubrious quarters.

Fifteenth Ward: Since the commencement of the survey, scarlet fever,
typhoid fever, smallpox, and cholera infantum have prevailed in the
tenant-houses of this ward. Six cases of smallpox occurred in one of
three thickly peopled rows of such dwellings, and the disease was
communicated to a child in an adjacent street, who had been playing in
the infected neighborhood. Seven cases of typhoid also occurred in a
court among children, and this was within a few doors of better class
houses.

Eleventh Ward: Typhus and typhoid fevers have been found prevailing
in all sections of this district. Smallpox, scarlatina, measles, and
pulmonary diseases are met with in almost every street. Typhus is the
most typical of the preventable diseases that abound in the Eleventh
Ward. Cholera infantum and obstinate diarrhoeal maladies were prevalent
in the rear tenements and throughout the lowest streets during the
summer and autumn.

To give you an idea of the wide prevalence of these diseases, I will
notice one or two more in detail.


[Sidenote: Smallpox]

Smallpox is the very type of preventable diseases. We have a safe
and sure preventive in thorough vaccination. And yet this loathsome
disease is at this moment an epidemic in New York. In two days' time,
the inspectors found 644 cases, and in two weeks, upward of 1,200;
and it was estimated that only about one-half were discovered. In
many large tenant-houses, six, eight, and ten cases were found at the
same time. They found it under every conceivable condition tending to
promote its communicability. It was in the street cars, in the stages,
in the hacks, on the ferry-boats, in junk-shops, in cigar-stores,
in candy-shops, in the families of tailors and seamstresses, who
were making clothing for wholesale stores, in public and in private
charities. I hold in my hand a list of cases of smallpox found
existing under circumstances which show how widespread is this disease.
Bedding of a fatal case of smallpox was sold to a rag-man; case in a
room where candy and daily papers were sold; case on a ferry-boat;
woman was attending bar and acting as nurse to her husband who had
smallpox; girl who was making cigars while scabs were falling from her
skin; seamstress who was making shirts for a Broadway store, one of
which was thrown over the cradle of a child sick of smallpox; tailors
making soldiers' clothing, have their children, from whom the scabs
were falling, wrapped in the garments; a woman selling vegetables had
the scabs falling from her face, among the vegetables, etc., etc.
Instances of this kind can be quoted at any length, but these examples
are sufficient to show that smallpox spreads uncontrolled throughout
our city. And they show, too, how this disease is disseminated abroad.
Says the Inspector of the Fourth Ward:


[Sidenote: Smallpox in Tailored Garments]

"In localities where smallpox prevailed I found, in some instances
within a few feet of the patients, tailors at work for our best
clothing establishments. Such infected vestments--worse than the tunic
of the Centaur--bring disease and death not only to the wearers, but
to many others. The occupant of the crowded tenant-house procures from
such a source a coat or a blanket, and soon a loathsome pest attacks
the young and unprotected members of his family, and ultimately spreads
through the entire quarter, destroying life after life and endangering
the health of a whole community.

"Smallpox, suddenly breaking out in some secluded rural district, often
owes its unsuspected origin to the above causes. In the remote solitude
of the ocean the seaman opens the chest in which he has deposited such
obnoxious apparel, and from this Pandora's box scatters the seeds of
pestilence among his comrades, which, ripening, shall spread its germs
to distant ports."

Or, what is more striking, take the following from the report of the
Inspector of the Fifth Ward:

"The largest wholesale establishments for the sale of dry goods
on this side of the Atlantic Ocean are in immediate contact with
the tenant-houses of the worst class, and which are infested with
smallpox and typhus fever. The two freight depots and the principal
passenger depot of the Railroad Company are in the same close
association with these nests of infection. In the region immediately
surrounding are also situated several hotels, and a large number of
boarding-houses, whose inmates are thus in danger of personal contact
with these diseases any moment. West Broadway, running through the
very centre of the district, is traversed by five different lines of
railway cars, with an average of five cars passing every minute, and
carrying millions of passengers yearly by the very doors of these
houses. Broadway, at but a short distance removed, is the principal
thoroughfare of the city. Hudson Street on the west is also a leading

_Here 85 Cases of Typhus Occurred in One Season_]

The tenant-house No. -- East Seventeenth Street, which reaks with
filth, gives the same history; upward of 85 cases, with a large
percentage of deaths, occurred in this single house during the past
season. And still it remained unclean and open to new tenants. I
could mention scores of these houses in every part of the tenant-house
district where typhus has apparently taken up its abode, and from
whence it sends out in every direction its deadly streams.

Not only have single houses become centres of contagion, but this
fever has, in many instances, become localized in crowded streets,
which to-day are almost impassable on account of the heaps of garbage,
and the courts and alleys of which are reeking with filth, making
them great centres of pestilence. From many of these tenements whole
families have been swept away.

[Illustration: BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF FEVER-NEST, 1865, NOT FAR FROM
BROADWAY AND FIFTH AVENUE]

Jersey Street, a short but uncleaned avenue, adjacent to a fashionable
part of Broadway, is another great depot of fever, which, according to
these records, frequently contained upward of thirty cases in progress
at one time. East Eleventh Street, between First and Second Avenues,
now, as all the past summer, in a horribly filthy condition, is a
local habitation of fever of the worst type. The same statement may be
made of nearly every district where the tenant-houses are especially
crowded, and the streets, courts, and alleys are unusually filthy.


[Sidenote: Intestinal Affections]

Intestinal diseases, as cholera infantum, diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid
fever, etc., which arise from, or are intensely aggravated by the
emanations from putrescible material in streets, courts, and alleys,
or from cesspools, privies, drain pipes, sewers, etc., were prevalent
in the tenant-house districts, creating, as usual, a vast amount of
sickness, and a large infant mortality. Very generally these diseases
were directly traceable to the decomposing filth, and in some instances
were stopped by the removal of the nuisance.

The Inspector of the Eighth Ward reports: "Cholera infantum has
probably consigned many more to the grave during the past summer than
all other diseases in my inspection district. In every case examined I
have found it associated with some well-marked course of insalubrity;
vegetable and animal decomposition have been the most prominent causes.
That fifty per cent die from preventable causes in my inspection
district I do not doubt."

The Inspector of the Sixth Ward says: "The mortality among children is
fearfully high, many families having lost all their children; others
four out of five or six."
Tenth Ward: The most prominent diseases during the past year have been
phthisis, typhoid and scarlet fevers, cholera infantum, dysentery,
smallpox, and diphtheria. They were most prevalent in the poorest part
of the district, having the lowest ground, the filthiest streets, and
the most dense population of poor and careless people, who are crowded
in the numerous tenant-houses, shanties, and small dwellings, which
were built for one or two families, but are now made to contain from
five to ten.

Nineteenth Ward: The diseases that have chiefly prevailed during the
past season are dysentery, diarrhoea, cholera morbus, cholera infantum
and the exanthematous fevers. They were of the most frequent occurrence
in the most crowded and insalubrious quarters.

Fifteenth Ward: Since the commencement of the survey, scarlet fever,
typhoid fever, smallpox, and cholera infantum have prevailed in the
tenant-houses of this ward. Six cases of smallpox occurred in one of
three thickly peopled rows of such dwellings, and the disease was
communicated to a child in an adjacent street, who had been playing in
the infected neighborhood. Seven cases of typhoid also occurred in a
court among children, and this was within a few doors of better class
houses.

Eleventh Ward: Typhus and typhoid fevers have been found prevailing
in all sections of this district. Smallpox, scarlatina, measles, and
pulmonary diseases are met with in almost every street. Typhus is the
most typical of the preventable diseases that abound in the Eleventh
Ward. Cholera infantum and obstinate diarrhoeal maladies were prevalent
in the rear tenements and throughout the lowest streets during the
summer and autumn.

To give you an idea of the wide prevalence of these diseases, I will
notice one or two more in detail.


[Sidenote: Smallpox]

Smallpox is the very type of preventable diseases. We have a safe
and sure preventive in thorough vaccination. And yet this loathsome
disease is at this moment an epidemic in New York. In two days' time,
the inspectors found 644 cases, and in two weeks, upward of 1,200;
and it was estimated that only about one-half were discovered. In
many large tenant-houses, six, eight, and ten cases were found at the
same time. They found it under every conceivable condition tending to
promote its communicability. It was in the street cars, in the stages,
in the hacks, on the ferry-boats, in junk-shops, in cigar-stores,
in candy-shops, in the families of tailors and seamstresses, who
were making clothing for wholesale stores, in public and in private
charities. I hold in my hand a list of cases of smallpox found
existing under circumstances which show how widespread is this disease.
Bedding of a fatal case of smallpox was sold to a rag-man; case in a
room where candy and daily papers were sold; case on a ferry-boat;
woman was attending bar and acting as nurse to her husband who had
smallpox; girl who was making cigars while scabs were falling from her
skin; seamstress who was making shirts for a Broadway store, one of
which was thrown over the cradle of a child sick of smallpox; tailors
making soldiers' clothing, have their children, from whom the scabs
were falling, wrapped in the garments; a woman selling vegetables had
the scabs falling from her face, among the vegetables, etc., etc.
Instances of this kind can be quoted at any length, but these examples
are sufficient to show that smallpox spreads uncontrolled throughout
our city. And they show, too, how this disease is disseminated abroad.
Says the Inspector of the Fourth Ward:


[Sidenote: Smallpox in Tailored Garments]

"In localities where smallpox prevailed I found, in some instances
within a few feet of the patients, tailors at work for our best
clothing establishments. Such infected vestments--worse than the tunic
of the Centaur--bring disease and death not only to the wearers, but
to many others. The occupant of the crowded tenant-house procures from
such a source a coat or a blanket, and soon a loathsome pest attacks
the young and unprotected members of his family, and ultimately spreads
through the entire quarter, destroying life after life and endangering
the health of a whole community.

"Smallpox, suddenly breaking out in some secluded rural district, often
owes its unsuspected origin to the above causes. In the remote solitude
of the ocean the seaman opens the chest in which he has deposited such
obnoxious apparel, and from this Pandora's box scatters the seeds of
pestilence among his comrades, which, ripening, shall spread its germs
to distant ports."

Or, what is more striking, take the following from the report of the
Inspector of the Fifth Ward:

"The largest wholesale establishments for the sale of dry goods
on this side of the Atlantic Ocean are in immediate contact with
the tenant-houses of the worst class, and which are infested with
smallpox and typhus fever. The two freight depots and the principal
passenger depot of the Railroad Company are in the same close
association with these nests of infection. In the region immediately
surrounding are also situated several hotels, and a large number of
boarding-houses, whose inmates are thus in danger of personal contact
with these diseases any moment. West Broadway, running through the
very centre of the district, is traversed by five different lines of
railway cars, with an average of five cars passing every minute, and
carrying millions of passengers yearly by the very doors of these
houses. Broadway, at but a short distance removed, is the principal
thoroughfare of the city. Hudson Street on the west is also a leading
route for city travel; and the cross streets of the district are
traversed daily by multitudes to reach various lines of steamboats,
cars, and steamships, which leave the city opposite this point.

[Illustration: A REGION OF SMALLPOX AND TYPHUS FEVER, 1865]

"All this large amount of daily travel passes through a region always
containing cases of typhus fever, and largely infected with smallpox.
Is it any cause of surprise that cases of these diseases are here
contracted, to be carried to distant sections of the country, there to
develop themselves, to the surprise and alarm of whole neighborhoods?
It is also well to remember that several large livery stables
are located in the immediate neighborhood, whose vehicles, it is
well-known, are frequently employed to carry persons, suffering from
these diseases, to hospitals, or to attend at funerals. These vehicles
are, perhaps, immediately afterward driven to the various car and
steamboat lines to secure passengers, who are thus exposed in the most
dangerous manner to these diseases."


[Sidenote: Typhus Fever]

Second only to smallpox as a preventable disease, but of a more fatal
character, is typhus fever. Typhus is greatly aggravated by domestic
filth, and by overcrowding, with deficient ventilation. The inspectors
found and located by street and number no less than 2,000 cases of this
most contagious and fatal disease. Commencing in a large tenant-house
in Mulberry Street, it was traced from locality to locality, in the
poorer quarters, until it was found to have visited nearly every
section of the city. It became localized in many tenant-houses and
streets, where it still remains, causing a large amount of sickness and
mortality.

At Mulberry Street, in a notoriously filthy house, it has existed
for more than four years. This house has a population of about 320,
which is renewed every few months. During the period alluded to, there
have been no less than 60 deaths by fever in this single house, and
240 cases. To-day this fever is raging uncontrolled in that house,
creating more orphans than many well-fought battles. Every new family
which enters these infected quarters is sure to fall a victim to this
pestilential disease.

vegetable and animal decomposition have been the most prominent causes.
That fifty per cent die from preventable causes in my inspection
district I do not doubt."

The Inspector of the Sixth Ward says: "The mortality among children is
fearfully high, many families having lost all their children; others
four out of five or six."
Tenth Ward: The most prominent diseases during the past year have been
phthisis, typhoid and scarlet fevers, cholera infantum, dysentery,
smallpox, and diphtheria. They were most prevalent in the poorest part
of the district, having the lowest ground, the filthiest streets, and
the most dense population of poor and careless people, who are crowded
in the numerous tenant-houses, shanties, and small dwellings, which
were built for one or two families, but are now made to contain from
five to ten.

Nineteenth Ward: The diseases that have chiefly prevailed during the
past season are dysentery, diarrhoea, cholera morbus, cholera infantum
and the exanthematous fevers. They were of the most frequent occurrence
in the most crowded and insalubrious quarters.

Fifteenth Ward: Since the commencement of the survey, scarlet fever,
typhoid fever, smallpox, and cholera infantum have prevailed in the
tenant-houses of this ward. Six cases of smallpox occurred in one of
three thickly peopled rows of such dwellings, and the disease was
communicated to a child in an adjacent street, who had been playing in
the infected neighborhood. Seven cases of typhoid also occurred in a
court among children, and this was within a few doors of better class
houses.

Eleventh Ward: Typhus and typhoid fevers have been found prevailing
in all sections of this district. Smallpox, scarlatina, measles, and
pulmonary diseases are met with in almost every street. Typhus is the
most typical of the preventable diseases that abound in the Eleventh
Ward. Cholera infantum and obstinate diarrhoeal maladies were prevalent
in the rear tenements and throughout the lowest streets during the
summer and autumn.

To give you an idea of the wide prevalence of these diseases, I will
notice one or two more in detail.


[Sidenote: Smallpox]

Smallpox is the very type of preventable diseases. We have a safe
and sure preventive in thorough vaccination. And yet this loathsome
disease is at this moment an epidemic in New York. In two days' time,
the inspectors found 644 cases, and in two weeks, upward of 1,200;
and it was estimated that only about one-half were discovered. In
many large tenant-houses, six, eight, and ten cases were found at the
same time. They found it under every conceivable condition tending to
promote its communicability. It was in the street cars, in the stages,
in the hacks, on the ferry-boats, in junk-shops, in cigar-stores,
in candy-shops, in the families of tailors and seamstresses, who
were making clothing for wholesale stores, in public and in private
charities. I hold in my hand a list of cases of smallpox found
existing under circumstances which show how widespread is this disease.
Bedding of a fatal case of smallpox was sold to a rag-man; case in a
room where candy and daily papers were sold; case on a ferry-boat;
woman was attending bar and acting as nurse to her husband who had
smallpox; girl who was making cigars while scabs were falling from her
skin; seamstress who was making shirts for a Broadway store, one of
which was thrown over the cradle of a child sick of smallpox; tailors
making soldiers' clothing, have their children, from whom the scabs
were falling, wrapped in the garments; a woman selling vegetables had
the scabs falling from her face, among the vegetables, etc., etc.
Instances of this kind can be quoted at any length, but these examples
are sufficient to show that smallpox spreads uncontrolled throughout
our city. And they show, too, how this disease is disseminated abroad.
Says the Inspector of the Fourth Ward:


[Sidenote: Smallpox in Tailored Garments]

"In localities where smallpox prevailed I found, in some instances
within a few feet of the patients, tailors at work for our best
clothing establishments. Such infected vestments--worse than the tunic
of the Centaur--bring disease and death not only to the wearers, but
to many others. The occupant of the crowded tenant-house procures from
such a source a coat or a blanket, and soon a loathsome pest attacks
the young and unprotected members of his family, and ultimately spreads
through the entire quarter, destroying life after life and endangering
the health of a whole community.

"Smallpox, suddenly breaking out in some secluded rural district, often
owes its unsuspected origin to the above causes. In the remote solitude
of the ocean the seaman opens the chest in which he has deposited such
obnoxious apparel, and from this Pandora's box scatters the seeds of
pestilence among his comrades, which, ripening, shall spread its germs
to distant ports."

Or, what is more striking, take the following from the report of the
Inspector of the Fifth Ward:

"The largest wholesale establishments for the sale of dry goods
on this side of the Atlantic Ocean are in immediate contact with
the tenant-houses of the worst class, and which are infested with
smallpox and typhus fever. The two freight depots and the principal
passenger depot of the Railroad Company are in the same close
association with these nests of infection. In the region immediately
surrounding are also situated several hotels, and a large number of
boarding-houses, whose inmates are thus in danger of personal contact
with these diseases any moment. West Broadway, running through the
very centre of the district, is traversed by five different lines of
railway cars, with an average of five cars passing every minute, and
carrying millions of passengers yearly by the very doors of these
houses. Broadway, at but a short distance removed, is the principal
thoroughfare of the city. Hudson Street on the west is also a leading
route for city travel; and the cross streets of the district are
traversed daily by multitudes to reach various lines of steamboats,
cars, and steamships, which leave the city opposite this point.

[Illustration: A REGION OF SMALLPOX AND TYPHUS FEVER, 1865]

"All this large amount of daily travel passes through a region always
containing cases of typhus fever, and largely infected with smallpox.
Is it any cause of surprise that cases of these diseases are here
contracted, to be carried to distant sections of the country, there to
develop themselves, to the surprise and alarm of whole neighborhoods?
It is also well to remember that several large livery stables
are located in the immediate neighborhood, whose vehicles, it is
well-known, are frequently employed to carry persons, suffering from
these diseases, to hospitals, or to attend at funerals. These vehicles
are, perhaps, immediately afterward driven to the various car and
steamboat lines to secure passengers, who are thus exposed in the most
dangerous manner to these diseases."


[Sidenote: Typhus Fever]

Second only to smallpox as a preventable disease, but of a more fatal
character, is typhus fever. Typhus is greatly aggravated by domestic
filth, and by overcrowding, with deficient ventilation. The inspectors
found and located by street and number no less than 2,000 cases of this
most contagious and fatal disease. Commencing in a large tenant-house
in Mulberry Street, it was traced from locality to locality, in the
poorer quarters, until it was found to have visited nearly every
section of the city. It became localized in many tenant-houses and
streets, where it still remains, causing a large amount of sickness and
mortality.

At Mulberry Street, in a notoriously filthy house, it has existed
for more than four years. This house has a population of about 320,
which is renewed every few months. During the period alluded to, there
have been no less than 60 deaths by fever in this single house, and
240 cases. To-day this fever is raging uncontrolled in that house,
creating more orphans than many well-fought battles. Every new family
which enters these infected quarters is sure to fall a victim to this
pestilential disease.

[Illustration: PLAN OF FEVER-NEST, EAST 17TH STREET, 1865

_Here 85 Cases of Typhus Occurred in One Season_]

The tenant-house No. -- East Seventeenth Street, which reaks with
filth, gives the same history; upward of 85 cases, with a large
percentage of deaths, occurred in this single house during the past
season. And still it remained unclean and open to new tenants. I
could mention scores of these houses in every part of the tenant-house
district where typhus has apparently taken up its abode, and from
whence it sends out in every direction its deadly streams.

Not only have single houses become centres of contagion, but this
fever has, in many instances, become localized in crowded streets,
which to-day are almost impassable on account of the heaps of garbage,
and the courts and alleys of which are reeking with filth, making
them great centres of pestilence. From many of these tenements whole
families have been swept away.

[Illustration: BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF FEVER-NEST, 1865, NOT FAR FROM
BROADWAY AND FIFTH AVENUE]

Jersey Street, a short but uncleaned avenue, adjacent to a fashionable
part of Broadway, is another great depot of fever, which, according to
these records, frequently contained upward of thirty cases in progress
at one time. East Eleventh Street, between First and Second Avenues,
now, as all the past summer, in a horribly filthy condition, is a
local habitation of fever of the worst type. The same statement may be
made of nearly every district where the tenant-houses are especially
crowded, and the streets, courts, and alleys are unusually filthy.


[Sidenote: Intestinal Affections]

Intestinal diseases, as cholera infantum, diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid
fever, etc., which arise from, or are intensely aggravated by the
emanations from putrescible material in streets, courts, and alleys,
or from cesspools, privies, drain pipes, sewers, etc., were prevalent
in the tenant-house districts, creating, as usual, a vast amount of
sickness, and a large infant mortality. Very generally these diseases
were directly traceable to the decomposing filth, and in some instances
were stopped by the removal of the nuisance.

The Inspector of the Eighth Ward reports: "Cholera infantum has
probably consigned many more to the grave during the past summer than
all other diseases in my inspection district. In every case examined I
have found it associated with some well-marked course of insalubrity;
vegetable and animal decomposition have been the most prominent causes.
That fifty per cent die from preventable causes in my inspection

and it was estimated that only about one-half were discovered. In
many large tenant-houses, six, eight, and ten cases were found at the
same time. They found it under every conceivable condition tending to
promote its communicability. It was in the street cars, in the stages,
in the hacks, on the ferry-boats, in junk-shops, in cigar-stores,
in candy-shops, in the families of tailors and seamstresses, who
were making clothing for wholesale stores, in public and in private
charities. I hold in my hand a list of cases of smallpox found
existing under circumstances which show how widespread is this disease.
Bedding of a fatal case of smallpox was sold to a rag-man; case in a
room where candy and daily papers were sold; case on a ferry-boat;
woman was attending bar and acting as nurse to her husband who had
smallpox; girl who was making cigars while scabs were falling from her
skin; seamstress who was making shirts for a Broadway store, one of
which was thrown over the cradle of a child sick of smallpox; tailors
making soldiers' clothing, have their children, from whom the scabs
were falling, wrapped in the garments; a woman selling vegetables had
the scabs falling from her face, among the vegetables, etc., etc.
Instances of this kind can be quoted at any length, but these examples
are sufficient to show that smallpox spreads uncontrolled throughout
our city. And they show, too, how this disease is disseminated abroad.
Says the Inspector of the Fourth Ward:


[Sidenote: Smallpox in Tailored Garments]

"In localities where smallpox prevailed I found, in some instances
within a few feet of the patients, tailors at work for our best
clothing establishments. Such infected vestments--worse than the tunic
of the Centaur--bring disease and death not only to the wearers, but
to many others. The occupant of the crowded tenant-house procures from
such a source a coat or a blanket, and soon a loathsome pest attacks
the young and unprotected members of his family, and ultimately spreads
through the entire quarter, destroying life after life and endangering
the health of a whole community.

"Smallpox, suddenly breaking out in some secluded rural district, often
owes its unsuspected origin to the above causes. In the remote solitude
of the ocean the seaman opens the chest in which he has deposited such
obnoxious apparel, and from this Pandora's box scatters the seeds of
pestilence among his comrades, which, ripening, shall spread its germs
to distant ports."

Or, what is more striking, take the following from the report of the
Inspector of the Fifth Ward:

"The largest wholesale establishments for the sale of dry goods
on this side of the Atlantic Ocean are in immediate contact with
the tenant-houses of the worst class, and which are infested with
smallpox and typhus fever. The two freight depots and the principal
passenger depot of the Railroad Company are in the same close
association with these nests of infection. In the region immediately
surrounding are also situated several hotels, and a large number of
boarding-houses, whose inmates are thus in danger of personal contact
with these diseases any moment. West Broadway, running through the
very centre of the district, is traversed by five different lines of
railway cars, with an average of five cars passing every minute, and
carrying millions of passengers yearly by the very doors of these
houses. Broadway, at but a short distance removed, is the principal
thoroughfare of the city. Hudson Street on the west is also a leading
route for city travel; and the cross streets of the district are
traversed daily by multitudes to reach various lines of steamboats,
cars, and steamships, which leave the city opposite this point.

[Illustration: A REGION OF SMALLPOX AND TYPHUS FEVER, 1865]

"All this large amount of daily travel passes through a region always
containing cases of typhus fever, and largely infected with smallpox.
Is it any cause of surprise that cases of these diseases are here
contracted, to be carried to distant sections of the country, there to
develop themselves, to the surprise and alarm of whole neighborhoods?
It is also well to remember that several large livery stables
are located in the immediate neighborhood, whose vehicles, it is
well-known, are frequently employed to carry persons, suffering from
these diseases, to hospitals, or to attend at funerals. These vehicles
are, perhaps, immediately afterward driven to the various car and
steamboat lines to secure passengers, who are thus exposed in the most
dangerous manner to these diseases."


[Sidenote: Typhus Fever]

Second only to smallpox as a preventable disease, but of a more fatal
character, is typhus fever. Typhus is greatly aggravated by domestic
filth, and by overcrowding, with deficient ventilation. The inspectors
found and located by street and number no less than 2,000 cases of this
most contagious and fatal disease. Commencing in a large tenant-house
in Mulberry Street, it was traced from locality to locality, in the
poorer quarters, until it was found to have visited nearly every
section of the city. It became localized in many tenant-houses and
streets, where it still remains, causing a large amount of sickness and
mortality.

At Mulberry Street, in a notoriously filthy house, it has existed
for more than four years. This house has a population of about 320,
which is renewed every few months. During the period alluded to, there
have been no less than 60 deaths by fever in this single house, and
240 cases. To-day this fever is raging uncontrolled in that house,
creating more orphans than many well-fought battles. Every new family
which enters these infected quarters is sure to fall a victim to this
pestilential disease.

[Illustration: PLAN OF FEVER-NEST, EAST 17TH STREET, 1865

_Here 85 Cases of Typhus Occurred in One Season_]

The tenant-house No. -- East Seventeenth Street, which reaks with
filth, gives the same history; upward of 85 cases, with a large
percentage of deaths, occurred in this single house during the past
season. And still it remained unclean and open to new tenants. I
could mention scores of these houses in every part of the tenant-house
district where typhus has apparently taken up its abode, and from
whence it sends out in every direction its deadly streams.

Not only have single houses become centres of contagion, but this
fever has, in many instances, become localized in crowded streets,
which to-day are almost impassable on account of the heaps of garbage,
and the courts and alleys of which are reeking with filth, making
them great centres of pestilence. From many of these tenements whole
families have been swept away.

[Illustration: BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF FEVER-NEST, 1865, NOT FAR FROM
BROADWAY AND FIFTH AVENUE]

Jersey Street, a short but uncleaned avenue, adjacent to a fashionable
part of Broadway, is another great depot of fever, which, according to
these records, frequently contained upward of thirty cases in progress
at one time. East Eleventh Street, between First and Second Avenues,
now, as all the past summer, in a horribly filthy condition, is a
local habitation of fever of the worst type. The same statement may be
made of nearly every district where the tenant-houses are especially
crowded, and the streets, courts, and alleys are unusually filthy.


[Sidenote: Intestinal Affections]

Intestinal diseases, as cholera infantum, diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid
fever, etc., which arise from, or are intensely aggravated by the
emanations from putrescible material in streets, courts, and alleys,
or from cesspools, privies, drain pipes, sewers, etc., were prevalent
in the tenant-house districts, creating, as usual, a vast amount of
sickness, and a large infant mortality. Very generally these diseases
were directly traceable to the decomposing filth, and in some instances
were stopped by the removal of the nuisance.

The Inspector of the Eighth Ward reports: "Cholera infantum has
probably consigned many more to the grave during the past summer than
all other diseases in my inspection district. In every case examined I
have found it associated with some well-marked course of insalubrity;
vegetable and animal decomposition have been the most prominent causes.
That fifty per cent die from preventable causes in my inspection
district I do not doubt."

The Inspector of the Sixth Ward says: "The mortality among children is
fearfully high, many families having lost all their children; others
four out of five or six."
Tenth Ward: The most prominent diseases during the past year have been
phthisis, typhoid and scarlet fevers, cholera infantum, dysentery,
smallpox, and diphtheria. They were most prevalent in the poorest part
of the district, having the lowest ground, the filthiest streets, and
the most dense population of poor and careless people, who are crowded
in the numerous tenant-houses, shanties, and small dwellings, which
were built for one or two families, but are now made to contain from
five to ten.

Nineteenth Ward: The diseases that have chiefly prevailed during the
past season are dysentery, diarrhoea, cholera morbus, cholera infantum
and the exanthematous fevers. They were of the most frequent occurrence
in the most crowded and insalubrious quarters.

Fifteenth Ward: Since the commencement of the survey, scarlet fever,
typhoid fever, smallpox, and cholera infantum have prevailed in the
tenant-houses of this ward. Six cases of smallpox occurred in one of
three thickly peopled rows of such dwellings, and the disease was
communicated to a child in an adjacent street, who had been playing in
the infected neighborhood. Seven cases of typhoid also occurred in a
court among children, and this was within a few doors of better class
houses.

Eleventh Ward: Typhus and typhoid fevers have been found prevailing
in all sections of this district. Smallpox, scarlatina, measles, and
pulmonary diseases are met with in almost every street. Typhus is the
most typical of the preventable diseases that abound in the Eleventh
Ward. Cholera infantum and obstinate diarrhoeal maladies were prevalent
in the rear tenements and throughout the lowest streets during the
summer and autumn.

To give you an idea of the wide prevalence of these diseases, I will
notice one or two more in detail.

obnoxious apparel, and from this Pandora's box scatters the seeds of
pestilence among his comrades, which, ripening, shall spread its germs
to distant ports."

Or, what is more striking, take the following from the report of the
Inspector of the Fifth Ward:

"The largest wholesale establishments for the sale of dry goods
on this side of the Atlantic Ocean are in immediate contact with
the tenant-houses of the worst class, and which are infested with
smallpox and typhus fever. The two freight depots and the principal
passenger depot of the Railroad Company are in the same close
association with these nests of infection. In the region immediately
surrounding are also situated several hotels, and a large number of
boarding-houses, whose inmates are thus in danger of personal contact
with these diseases any moment. West Broadway, running through the
very centre of the district, is traversed by five different lines of
railway cars, with an average of five cars passing every minute, and
carrying millions of passengers yearly by the very doors of these
houses. Broadway, at but a short distance removed, is the principal
thoroughfare of the city. Hudson Street on the west is also a leading
route for city travel; and the cross streets of the district are
traversed daily by multitudes to reach various lines of steamboats,
cars, and steamships, which leave the city opposite this point.

[Illustration: A REGION OF SMALLPOX AND TYPHUS FEVER, 1865]

"All this large amount of daily travel passes through a region always
containing cases of typhus fever, and largely infected with smallpox.
Is it any cause of surprise that cases of these diseases are here
contracted, to be carried to distant sections of the country, there to
develop themselves, to the surprise and alarm of whole neighborhoods?
It is also well to remember that several large livery stables
are located in the immediate neighborhood, whose vehicles, it is
well-known, are frequently employed to carry persons, suffering from
these diseases, to hospitals, or to attend at funerals. These vehicles
are, perhaps, immediately afterward driven to the various car and
steamboat lines to secure passengers, who are thus exposed in the most
dangerous manner to these diseases."


[Sidenote: Typhus Fever]

Second only to smallpox as a preventable disease, but of a more fatal
character, is typhus fever. Typhus is greatly aggravated by domestic
filth, and by overcrowding, with deficient ventilation. The inspectors
found and located by street and number no less than 2,000 cases of this
most contagious and fatal disease. Commencing in a large tenant-house
in Mulberry Street, it was traced from locality to locality, in the
poorer quarters, until it was found to have visited nearly every
section of the city. It became localized in many tenant-houses and
streets, where it still remains, causing a large amount of sickness and
mortality.

At Mulberry Street, in a notoriously filthy house, it has existed
for more than four years. This house has a population of about 320,
which is renewed every few months. During the period alluded to, there
have been no less than 60 deaths by fever in this single house, and
240 cases. To-day this fever is raging uncontrolled in that house,
creating more orphans than many well-fought battles. Every new family
which enters these infected quarters is sure to fall a victim to this
pestilential disease.

[Illustration: PLAN OF FEVER-NEST, EAST 17TH STREET, 1865

_Here 85 Cases of Typhus Occurred in One Season_]

The tenant-house No. -- East Seventeenth Street, which reaks with
filth, gives the same history; upward of 85 cases, with a large
percentage of deaths, occurred in this single house during the past
season. And still it remained unclean and open to new tenants. I
could mention scores of these houses in every part of the tenant-house
district where typhus has apparently taken up its abode, and from
whence it sends out in every direction its deadly streams.

Not only have single houses become centres of contagion, but this
fever has, in many instances, become localized in crowded streets,
which to-day are almost impassable on account of the heaps of garbage,
and the courts and alleys of which are reeking with filth, making
them great centres of pestilence. From many of these tenements whole
families have been swept away.

[Illustration: BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF FEVER-NEST, 1865, NOT FAR FROM
BROADWAY AND FIFTH AVENUE]

Jersey Street, a short but uncleaned avenue, adjacent to a fashionable
part of Broadway, is another great depot of fever, which, according to
these records, frequently contained upward of thirty cases in progress
at one time. East Eleventh Street, between First and Second Avenues,
now, as all the past summer, in a horribly filthy condition, is a
local habitation of fever of the worst type. The same statement may be
made of nearly every district where the tenant-houses are especially
crowded, and the streets, courts, and alleys are unusually filthy.


[Sidenote: Intestinal Affections]

Intestinal diseases, as cholera infantum, diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid
fever, etc., which arise from, or are intensely aggravated by the
emanations from putrescible material in streets, courts, and alleys,
or from cesspools, privies, drain pipes, sewers, etc., were prevalent
in the tenant-house districts, creating, as usual, a vast amount of
sickness, and a large infant mortality. Very generally these diseases
were directly traceable to the decomposing filth, and in some instances
were stopped by the removal of the nuisance.

The Inspector of the Eighth Ward reports: "Cholera infantum has
probably consigned many more to the grave during the past summer than
all other diseases in my inspection district. In every case examined I
have found it associated with some well-marked course of insalubrity;
vegetable and animal decomposition have been the most prominent causes.
That fifty per cent die from preventable causes in my inspection
district I do not doubt."

The Inspector of the Sixth Ward says: "The mortality among children is
fearfully high, many families having lost all their children; others
four out of five or six."
Tenth Ward: The most prominent diseases during the past year have been
phthisis, typhoid and scarlet fevers, cholera infantum, dysentery,
smallpox, and diphtheria. They were most prevalent in the poorest part
of the district, having the lowest ground, the filthiest streets, and
the most dense population of poor and careless people, who are crowded
in the numerous tenant-houses, shanties, and small dwellings, which
were built for one or two families, but are now made to contain from
five to ten.

Nineteenth Ward: The diseases that have chiefly prevailed during the
past season are dysentery, diarrhoea, cholera morbus, cholera infantum
and the exanthematous fevers. They were of the most frequent occurrence
in the most crowded and insalubrious quarters.

Fifteenth Ward: Since the commencement of the survey, scarlet fever,
typhoid fever, smallpox, and cholera infantum have prevailed in the
tenant-houses of this ward. Six cases of smallpox occurred in one of
three thickly peopled rows of such dwellings, and the disease was
communicated to a child in an adjacent street, who had been playing in
the infected neighborhood. Seven cases of typhoid also occurred in a
court among children, and this was within a few doors of better class
houses.

Eleventh Ward: Typhus and typhoid fevers have been found prevailing
in all sections of this district. Smallpox, scarlatina, measles, and
pulmonary diseases are met with in almost every street. Typhus is the
most typical of the preventable diseases that abound in the Eleventh
Ward. Cholera infantum and obstinate diarrhoeal maladies were prevalent
in the rear tenements and throughout the lowest streets during the
summer and autumn.

To give you an idea of the wide prevalence of these diseases, I will
notice one or two more in detail.


[Sidenote: Smallpox]

Smallpox is the very type of preventable diseases. We have a safe
and sure preventive in thorough vaccination. And yet this loathsome
disease is at this moment an epidemic in New York. In two days' time,
the inspectors found 644 cases, and in two weeks, upward of 1,200;
and it was estimated that only about one-half were discovered. In
many large tenant-houses, six, eight, and ten cases were found at the
same time. They found it under every conceivable condition tending to
promote its communicability. It was in the street cars, in the stages,
in the hacks, on the ferry-boats, in junk-shops, in cigar-stores,
in candy-shops, in the families of tailors and seamstresses, who
were making clothing for wholesale stores, in public and in private
charities. I hold in my hand a list of cases of smallpox found
existing under circumstances which show how widespread is this disease.
Bedding of a fatal case of smallpox was sold to a rag-man; case in a
room where candy and daily papers were sold; case on a ferry-boat;
woman was attending bar and acting as nurse to her husband who had
smallpox; girl who was making cigars while scabs were falling from her
skin; seamstress who was making shirts for a Broadway store, one of
which was thrown over the cradle of a child sick of smallpox; tailors
making soldiers' clothing, have their children, from whom the scabs
were falling, wrapped in the garments; a woman selling vegetables had
the scabs falling from her face, among the vegetables, etc., etc.
Instances of this kind can be quoted at any length, but these examples
are sufficient to show that smallpox spreads uncontrolled throughout
our city. And they show, too, how this disease is disseminated abroad.
Says the Inspector of the Fourth Ward:


[Sidenote: Smallpox in Tailored Garments]

"In localities where smallpox prevailed I found, in some instances
within a few feet of the patients, tailors at work for our best
clothing establishments. Such infected vestments--worse than the tunic
of the Centaur--bring disease and death not only to the wearers, but
to many others. The occupant of the crowded tenant-house procures from
such a source a coat or a blanket, and soon a loathsome pest attacks
the young and unprotected members of his family, and ultimately spreads
through the entire quarter, destroying life after life and endangering
the health of a whole community.

"Smallpox, suddenly breaking out in some secluded rural district, often
owes its unsuspected origin to the above causes. In the remote solitude
of the ocean the seaman opens the chest in which he has deposited such
obnoxious apparel, and from this Pandora's box scatters the seeds of
pestilence among his comrades, which, ripening, shall spread its germs

found and located by street and number no less than 2,000 cases of this
most contagious and fatal disease. Commencing in a large tenant-house
in Mulberry Street, it was traced from locality to locality, in the
poorer quarters, until it was found to have visited nearly every
section of the city. It became localized in many tenant-houses and
streets, where it still remains, causing a large amount of sickness and
mortality.

At Mulberry Street, in a notoriously filthy house, it has existed
for more than four years. This house has a population of about 320,
which is renewed every few months. During the period alluded to, there
have been no less than 60 deaths by fever in this single house, and
240 cases. To-day this fever is raging uncontrolled in that house,
creating more orphans than many well-fought battles. Every new family
which enters these infected quarters is sure to fall a victim to this
pestilential disease.

[Illustration: PLAN OF FEVER-NEST, EAST 17TH STREET, 1865

_Here 85 Cases of Typhus Occurred in One Season_]

The tenant-house No. -- East Seventeenth Street, which reaks with
filth, gives the same history; upward of 85 cases, with a large
percentage of deaths, occurred in this single house during the past
season. And still it remained unclean and open to new tenants. I
could mention scores of these houses in every part of the tenant-house
district where typhus has apparently taken up its abode, and from
whence it sends out in every direction its deadly streams.

Not only have single houses become centres of contagion, but this
fever has, in many instances, become localized in crowded streets,
which to-day are almost impassable on account of the heaps of garbage,
and the courts and alleys of which are reeking with filth, making
them great centres of pestilence. From many of these tenements whole
families have been swept away.

[Illustration: BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF FEVER-NEST, 1865, NOT FAR FROM
BROADWAY AND FIFTH AVENUE]

Jersey Street, a short but uncleaned avenue, adjacent to a fashionable
part of Broadway, is another great depot of fever, which, according to
these records, frequently contained upward of thirty cases in progress
at one time. East Eleventh Street, between First and Second Avenues,
now, as all the past summer, in a horribly filthy condition, is a
local habitation of fever of the worst type. The same statement may be
made of nearly every district where the tenant-houses are especially
crowded, and the streets, courts, and alleys are unusually filthy.


[Sidenote: Intestinal Affections]

Intestinal diseases, as cholera infantum, diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid
fever, etc., which arise from, or are intensely aggravated by the
emanations from putrescible material in streets, courts, and alleys,
or from cesspools, privies, drain pipes, sewers, etc., were prevalent
in the tenant-house districts, creating, as usual, a vast amount of
sickness, and a large infant mortality. Very generally these diseases
were directly traceable to the decomposing filth, and in some instances
were stopped by the removal of the nuisance.

The Inspector of the Eighth Ward reports: "Cholera infantum has
probably consigned many more to the grave during the past summer than
all other diseases in my inspection district. In every case examined I
have found it associated with some well-marked course of insalubrity;
vegetable and animal decomposition have been the most prominent causes.
That fifty per cent die from preventable causes in my inspection
district I do not doubt."

The Inspector of the Sixth Ward says: "The mortality among children is
fearfully high, many families having lost all their children; others
four out of five or six."
Tenth Ward: The most prominent diseases during the past year have been
phthisis, typhoid and scarlet fevers, cholera infantum, dysentery,
smallpox, and diphtheria. They were most prevalent in the poorest part
of the district, having the lowest ground, the filthiest streets, and
the most dense population of poor and careless people, who are crowded
in the numerous tenant-houses, shanties, and small dwellings, which
were built for one or two families, but are now made to contain from
five to ten.

Nineteenth Ward: The diseases that have chiefly prevailed during the
past season are dysentery, diarrhoea, cholera morbus, cholera infantum
and the exanthematous fevers. They were of the most frequent occurrence
in the most crowded and insalubrious quarters.

Fifteenth Ward: Since the commencement of the survey, scarlet fever,
typhoid fever, smallpox, and cholera infantum have prevailed in the
tenant-houses of this ward. Six cases of smallpox occurred in one of
three thickly peopled rows of such dwellings, and the disease was
communicated to a child in an adjacent street, who had been playing in
the infected neighborhood. Seven cases of typhoid also occurred in a
court among children, and this was within a few doors of better class
houses.

Eleventh Ward: Typhus and typhoid fevers have been found prevailing
in all sections of this district. Smallpox, scarlatina, measles, and
pulmonary diseases are met with in almost every street. Typhus is the
most typical of the preventable diseases that abound in the Eleventh
Ward. Cholera infantum and obstinate diarrhoeal maladies were prevalent
in the rear tenements and throughout the lowest streets during the
summer and autumn.

To give you an idea of the wide prevalence of these diseases, I will
notice one or two more in detail.


[Sidenote: Smallpox]

Smallpox is the very type of preventable diseases. We have a safe
and sure preventive in thorough vaccination. And yet this loathsome
disease is at this moment an epidemic in New York. In two days' time,
the inspectors found 644 cases, and in two weeks, upward of 1,200;
and it was estimated that only about one-half were discovered. In
many large tenant-houses, six, eight, and ten cases were found at the
same time. They found it under every conceivable condition tending to
promote its communicability. It was in the street cars, in the stages,
in the hacks, on the ferry-boats, in junk-shops, in cigar-stores,
in candy-shops, in the families of tailors and seamstresses, who
were making clothing for wholesale stores, in public and in private
charities. I hold in my hand a list of cases of smallpox found
existing under circumstances which show how widespread is this disease.
Bedding of a fatal case of smallpox was sold to a rag-man; case in a
room where candy and daily papers were sold; case on a ferry-boat;
woman was attending bar and acting as nurse to her husband who had
smallpox; girl who was making cigars while scabs were falling from her
skin; seamstress who was making shirts for a Broadway store, one of
which was thrown over the cradle of a child sick of smallpox; tailors
making soldiers' clothing, have their children, from whom the scabs
were falling, wrapped in the garments; a woman selling vegetables had
the scabs falling from her face, among the vegetables, etc., etc.
Instances of this kind can be quoted at any length, but these examples
are sufficient to show that smallpox spreads uncontrolled throughout
our city. And they show, too, how this disease is disseminated abroad.
Says the Inspector of the Fourth Ward:


[Sidenote: Smallpox in Tailored Garments]

"In localities where smallpox prevailed I found, in some instances
within a few feet of the patients, tailors at work for our best
clothing establishments. Such infected vestments--worse than the tunic
of the Centaur--bring disease and death not only to the wearers, but
to many others. The occupant of the crowded tenant-house procures from
such a source a coat or a blanket, and soon a loathsome pest attacks
the young and unprotected members of his family, and ultimately spreads
through the entire quarter, destroying life after life and endangering
the health of a whole community.

"Smallpox, suddenly breaking out in some secluded rural district, often
owes its unsuspected origin to the above causes. In the remote solitude
of the ocean the seaman opens the chest in which he has deposited such
obnoxious apparel, and from this Pandora's box scatters the seeds of
pestilence among his comrades, which, ripening, shall spread its germs
to distant ports."

Or, what is more striking, take the following from the report of the
Inspector of the Fifth Ward:

"The largest wholesale establishments for the sale of dry goods
on this side of the Atlantic Ocean are in immediate contact with
the tenant-houses of the worst class, and which are infested with
smallpox and typhus fever. The two freight depots and the principal
passenger depot of the Railroad Company are in the same close
association with these nests of infection. In the region immediately
surrounding are also situated several hotels, and a large number of
boarding-houses, whose inmates are thus in danger of personal contact
with these diseases any moment. West Broadway, running through the
very centre of the district, is traversed by five different lines of
railway cars, with an average of five cars passing every minute, and
carrying millions of passengers yearly by the very doors of these
houses. Broadway, at but a short distance removed, is the principal
thoroughfare of the city. Hudson Street on the west is also a leading
route for city travel; and the cross streets of the district are
traversed daily by multitudes to reach various lines of steamboats,
cars, and steamships, which leave the city opposite this point.

[Illustration: A REGION OF SMALLPOX AND TYPHUS FEVER, 1865]

"All this large amount of daily travel passes through a region always
containing cases of typhus fever, and largely infected with smallpox.
Is it any cause of surprise that cases of these diseases are here
contracted, to be carried to distant sections of the country, there to
develop themselves, to the surprise and alarm of whole neighborhoods?
It is also well to remember that several large livery stables
are located in the immediate neighborhood, whose vehicles, it is
well-known, are frequently employed to carry persons, suffering from
these diseases, to hospitals, or to attend at funerals. These vehicles
are, perhaps, immediately afterward driven to the various car and
steamboat lines to secure passengers, who are thus exposed in the most
dangerous manner to these diseases."

local habitation of fever of the worst type. The same statement may be
made of nearly every district where the tenant-houses are especially
crowded, and the streets, courts, and alleys are unusually filthy.


[Sidenote: Intestinal Affections]

Intestinal diseases, as cholera infantum, diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid
fever, etc., which arise from, or are intensely aggravated by the
emanations from putrescible material in streets, courts, and alleys,
or from cesspools, privies, drain pipes, sewers, etc., were prevalent
in the tenant-house districts, creating, as usual, a vast amount of
sickness, and a large infant mortality. Very generally these diseases
were directly traceable to the decomposing filth, and in some instances
were stopped by the removal of the nuisance.

The Inspector of the Eighth Ward reports: "Cholera infantum has
probably consigned many more to the grave during the past summer than
all other diseases in my inspection district. In every case examined I
have found it associated with some well-marked course of insalubrity;
vegetable and animal decomposition have been the most prominent causes.
That fifty per cent die from preventable causes in my inspection
district I do not doubt."

The Inspector of the Sixth Ward says: "The mortality among children is
fearfully high, many families having lost all their children; others
four out of five or six."
Tenth Ward: The most prominent diseases during the past year have been
phthisis, typhoid and scarlet fevers, cholera infantum, dysentery,
smallpox, and diphtheria. They were most prevalent in the poorest part
of the district, having the lowest ground, the filthiest streets, and
the most dense population of poor and careless people, who are crowded
in the numerous tenant-houses, shanties, and small dwellings, which
were built for one or two families, but are now made to contain from
five to ten.

Nineteenth Ward: The diseases that have chiefly prevailed during the
past season are dysentery, diarrhoea, cholera morbus, cholera infantum
and the exanthematous fevers. They were of the most frequent occurrence
in the most crowded and insalubrious quarters.

Fifteenth Ward: Since the commencement of the survey, scarlet fever,
typhoid fever, smallpox, and cholera infantum have prevailed in the
tenant-houses of this ward. Six cases of smallpox occurred in one of
three thickly peopled rows of such dwellings, and the disease was
communicated to a child in an adjacent street, who had been playing in
the infected neighborhood. Seven cases of typhoid also occurred in a
court among children, and this was within a few doors of better class
houses.

Eleventh Ward: Typhus and typhoid fevers have been found prevailing
in all sections of this district. Smallpox, scarlatina, measles, and
pulmonary diseases are met with in almost every street. Typhus is the
most typical of the preventable diseases that abound in the Eleventh
Ward. Cholera infantum and obstinate diarrhoeal maladies were prevalent
in the rear tenements and throughout the lowest streets during the
summer and autumn.

To give you an idea of the wide prevalence of these diseases, I will
notice one or two more in detail.


[Sidenote: Smallpox]

Smallpox is the very type of preventable diseases. We have a safe
and sure preventive in thorough vaccination. And yet this loathsome
disease is at this moment an epidemic in New York. In two days' time,
the inspectors found 644 cases, and in two weeks, upward of 1,200;
and it was estimated that only about one-half were discovered. In
many large tenant-houses, six, eight, and ten cases were found at the
same time. They found it under every conceivable condition tending to
promote its communicability. It was in the street cars, in the stages,
in the hacks, on the ferry-boats, in junk-shops, in cigar-stores,
in candy-shops, in the families of tailors and seamstresses, who
were making clothing for wholesale stores, in public and in private
charities. I hold in my hand a list of cases of smallpox found
existing under circumstances which show how widespread is this disease.
Bedding of a fatal case of smallpox was sold to a rag-man; case in a
room where candy and daily papers were sold; case on a ferry-boat;
woman was attending bar and acting as nurse to her husband who had
smallpox; girl who was making cigars while scabs were falling from her
skin; seamstress who was making shirts for a Broadway store, one of
which was thrown over the cradle of a child sick of smallpox; tailors
making soldiers' clothing, have their children, from whom the scabs
were falling, wrapped in the garments; a woman selling vegetables had
the scabs falling from her face, among the vegetables, etc., etc.
Instances of this kind can be quoted at any length, but these examples
are sufficient to show that smallpox spreads uncontrolled throughout
our city. And they show, too, how this disease is disseminated abroad.
Says the Inspector of the Fourth Ward:


[Sidenote: Smallpox in Tailored Garments]

"In localities where smallpox prevailed I found, in some instances
within a few feet of the patients, tailors at work for our best
clothing establishments. Such infected vestments--worse than the tunic
of the Centaur--bring disease and death not only to the wearers, but
to many others. The occupant of the crowded tenant-house procures from
such a source a coat or a blanket, and soon a loathsome pest attacks
the young and unprotected members of his family, and ultimately spreads
through the entire quarter, destroying life after life and endangering
the health of a whole community.

"Smallpox, suddenly breaking out in some secluded rural district, often
owes its unsuspected origin to the above causes. In the remote solitude
of the ocean the seaman opens the chest in which he has deposited such
obnoxious apparel, and from this Pandora's box scatters the seeds of
pestilence among his comrades, which, ripening, shall spread its germs
to distant ports."

Or, what is more striking, take the following from the report of the
Inspector of the Fifth Ward:

"The largest wholesale establishments for the sale of dry goods
on this side of the Atlantic Ocean are in immediate contact with
the tenant-houses of the worst class, and which are infested with
smallpox and typhus fever. The two freight depots and the principal
passenger depot of the Railroad Company are in the same close
association with these nests of infection. In the region immediately
surrounding are also situated several hotels, and a large number of
boarding-houses, whose inmates are thus in danger of personal contact
with these diseases any moment. West Broadway, running through the
very centre of the district, is traversed by five different lines of
railway cars, with an average of five cars passing every minute, and
carrying millions of passengers yearly by the very doors of these
houses. Broadway, at but a short distance removed, is the principal
thoroughfare of the city. Hudson Street on the west is also a leading
route for city travel; and the cross streets of the district are
traversed daily by multitudes to reach various lines of steamboats,
cars, and steamships, which leave the city opposite this point.

[Illustration: A REGION OF SMALLPOX AND TYPHUS FEVER, 1865]

"All this large amount of daily travel passes through a region always
containing cases of typhus fever, and largely infected with smallpox.
Is it any cause of surprise that cases of these diseases are here
contracted, to be carried to distant sections of the country, there to
develop themselves, to the surprise and alarm of whole neighborhoods?
It is also well to remember that several large livery stables
are located in the immediate neighborhood, whose vehicles, it is
well-known, are frequently employed to carry persons, suffering from
these diseases, to hospitals, or to attend at funerals. These vehicles
are, perhaps, immediately afterward driven to the various car and
steamboat lines to secure passengers, who are thus exposed in the most
dangerous manner to these diseases."


[Sidenote: Typhus Fever]

Second only to smallpox as a preventable disease, but of a more fatal
character, is typhus fever. Typhus is greatly aggravated by domestic
filth, and by overcrowding, with deficient ventilation. The inspectors
found and located by street and number no less than 2,000 cases of this
most contagious and fatal disease. Commencing in a large tenant-house
in Mulberry Street, it was traced from locality to locality, in the
poorer quarters, until it was found to have visited nearly every
section of the city. It became localized in many tenant-houses and
streets, where it still remains, causing a large amount of sickness and
mortality.

At Mulberry Street, in a notoriously filthy house, it has existed
for more than four years. This house has a population of about 320,
which is renewed every few months. During the period alluded to, there
have been no less than 60 deaths by fever in this single house, and
240 cases. To-day this fever is raging uncontrolled in that house,
creating more orphans than many well-fought battles. Every new family
which enters these infected quarters is sure to fall a victim to this
pestilential disease.

[Illustration: PLAN OF FEVER-NEST, EAST 17TH STREET, 1865

_Here 85 Cases of Typhus Occurred in One Season_]

The tenant-house No. -- East Seventeenth Street, which reaks with
filth, gives the same history; upward of 85 cases, with a large
percentage of deaths, occurred in this single house during the past
season. And still it remained unclean and open to new tenants. I
could mention scores of these houses in every part of the tenant-house
district where typhus has apparently taken up its abode, and from
whence it sends out in every direction its deadly streams.

Not only have single houses become centres of contagion, but this
fever has, in many instances, become localized in crowded streets,
which to-day are almost impassable on account of the heaps of garbage,
and the courts and alleys of which are reeking with filth, making
them great centres of pestilence. From many of these tenements whole
families have been swept away.

[Illustration: BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF FEVER-NEST, 1865, NOT FAR FROM
BROADWAY AND FIFTH AVENUE]

Jersey Street, a short but uncleaned avenue, adjacent to a fashionable
part of Broadway, is another great depot of fever, which, according to
these records, frequently contained upward of thirty cases in progress
at one time. East Eleventh Street, between First and Second Avenues,
now, as all the past summer, in a horribly filthy condition, is a
local habitation of fever of the worst type. The same statement may be

communicated to a child in an adjacent street, who had been playing in
the infected neighborhood. Seven cases of typhoid also occurred in a
court among children, and this was within a few doors of better class
houses.

Eleventh Ward: Typhus and typhoid fevers have been found prevailing
in all sections of this district. Smallpox, scarlatina, measles, and
pulmonary diseases are met with in almost every street. Typhus is the
most typical of the preventable diseases that abound in the Eleventh
Ward. Cholera infantum and obstinate diarrhoeal maladies were prevalent
in the rear tenements and throughout the lowest streets during the
summer and autumn.

To give you an idea of the wide prevalence of these diseases, I will
notice one or two more in detail.


[Sidenote: Smallpox]

Smallpox is the very type of preventable diseases. We have a safe
and sure preventive in thorough vaccination. And yet this loathsome
disease is at this moment an epidemic in New York. In two days' time,
the inspectors found 644 cases, and in two weeks, upward of 1,200;
and it was estimated that only about one-half were discovered. In
many large tenant-houses, six, eight, and ten cases were found at the
same time. They found it under every conceivable condition tending to
promote its communicability. It was in the street cars, in the stages,
in the hacks, on the ferry-boats, in junk-shops, in cigar-stores,
in candy-shops, in the families of tailors and seamstresses, who
were making clothing for wholesale stores, in public and in private
charities. I hold in my hand a list of cases of smallpox found
existing under circumstances which show how widespread is this disease.
Bedding of a fatal case of smallpox was sold to a rag-man; case in a
room where candy and daily papers were sold; case on a ferry-boat;
woman was attending bar and acting as nurse to her husband who had
smallpox; girl who was making cigars while scabs were falling from her
skin; seamstress who was making shirts for a Broadway store, one of
which was thrown over the cradle of a child sick of smallpox; tailors
making soldiers' clothing, have their children, from whom the scabs
were falling, wrapped in the garments; a woman selling vegetables had
the scabs falling from her face, among the vegetables, etc., etc.
Instances of this kind can be quoted at any length, but these examples
are sufficient to show that smallpox spreads uncontrolled throughout
our city. And they show, too, how this disease is disseminated abroad.
Says the Inspector of the Fourth Ward:


[Sidenote: Smallpox in Tailored Garments]

"In localities where smallpox prevailed I found, in some instances
within a few feet of the patients, tailors at work for our best
clothing establishments. Such infected vestments--worse than the tunic
of the Centaur--bring disease and death not only to the wearers, but
to many others. The occupant of the crowded tenant-house procures from
such a source a coat or a blanket, and soon a loathsome pest attacks
the young and unprotected members of his family, and ultimately spreads
through the entire quarter, destroying life after life and endangering
the health of a whole community.

"Smallpox, suddenly breaking out in some secluded rural district, often
owes its unsuspected origin to the above causes. In the remote solitude
of the ocean the seaman opens the chest in which he has deposited such
obnoxious apparel, and from this Pandora's box scatters the seeds of
pestilence among his comrades, which, ripening, shall spread its germs
to distant ports."

Or, what is more striking, take the following from the report of the
Inspector of the Fifth Ward:

"The largest wholesale establishments for the sale of dry goods
on this side of the Atlantic Ocean are in immediate contact with
the tenant-houses of the worst class, and which are infested with
smallpox and typhus fever. The two freight depots and the principal
passenger depot of the Railroad Company are in the same close
association with these nests of infection. In the region immediately
surrounding are also situated several hotels, and a large number of
boarding-houses, whose inmates are thus in danger of personal contact
with these diseases any moment. West Broadway, running through the
very centre of the district, is traversed by five different lines of
railway cars, with an average of five cars passing every minute, and
carrying millions of passengers yearly by the very doors of these
houses. Broadway, at but a short distance removed, is the principal
thoroughfare of the city. Hudson Street on the west is also a leading
route for city travel; and the cross streets of the district are
traversed daily by multitudes to reach various lines of steamboats,
cars, and steamships, which leave the city opposite this point.

[Illustration: A REGION OF SMALLPOX AND TYPHUS FEVER, 1865]

"All this large amount of daily travel passes through a region always
containing cases of typhus fever, and largely infected with smallpox.
Is it any cause of surprise that cases of these diseases are here
contracted, to be carried to distant sections of the country, there to
develop themselves, to the surprise and alarm of whole neighborhoods?
It is also well to remember that several large livery stables
are located in the immediate neighborhood, whose vehicles, it is
well-known, are frequently employed to carry persons, suffering from
these diseases, to hospitals, or to attend at funerals. These vehicles
are, perhaps, immediately afterward driven to the various car and
steamboat lines to secure passengers, who are thus exposed in the most
dangerous manner to these diseases."


[Sidenote: Typhus Fever]

Second only to smallpox as a preventable disease, but of a more fatal
character, is typhus fever. Typhus is greatly aggravated by domestic
filth, and by overcrowding, with deficient ventilation. The inspectors
found and located by street and number no less than 2,000 cases of this
most contagious and fatal disease. Commencing in a large tenant-house
in Mulberry Street, it was traced from locality to locality, in the
poorer quarters, until it was found to have visited nearly every
section of the city. It became localized in many tenant-houses and
streets, where it still remains, causing a large amount of sickness and
mortality.

At Mulberry Street, in a notoriously filthy house, it has existed
for more than four years. This house has a population of about 320,
which is renewed every few months. During the period alluded to, there
have been no less than 60 deaths by fever in this single house, and
240 cases. To-day this fever is raging uncontrolled in that house,
creating more orphans than many well-fought battles. Every new family
which enters these infected quarters is sure to fall a victim to this
pestilential disease.

[Illustration: PLAN OF FEVER-NEST, EAST 17TH STREET, 1865

_Here 85 Cases of Typhus Occurred in One Season_]

The tenant-house No. -- East Seventeenth Street, which reaks with
filth, gives the same history; upward of 85 cases, with a large
percentage of deaths, occurred in this single house during the past
season. And still it remained unclean and open to new tenants. I
could mention scores of these houses in every part of the tenant-house
district where typhus has apparently taken up its abode, and from
whence it sends out in every direction its deadly streams.

Not only have single houses become centres of contagion, but this
fever has, in many instances, become localized in crowded streets,
which to-day are almost impassable on account of the heaps of garbage,
and the courts and alleys of which are reeking with filth, making
them great centres of pestilence. From many of these tenements whole
families have been swept away.

[Illustration: BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF FEVER-NEST, 1865, NOT FAR FROM
BROADWAY AND FIFTH AVENUE]

Jersey Street, a short but uncleaned avenue, adjacent to a fashionable
part of Broadway, is another great depot of fever, which, according to
these records, frequently contained upward of thirty cases in progress
at one time. East Eleventh Street, between First and Second Avenues,
now, as all the past summer, in a horribly filthy condition, is a
local habitation of fever of the worst type. The same statement may be
made of nearly every district where the tenant-houses are especially
crowded, and the streets, courts, and alleys are unusually filthy.


[Sidenote: Intestinal Affections]

Intestinal diseases, as cholera infantum, diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid
fever, etc., which arise from, or are intensely aggravated by the
emanations from putrescible material in streets, courts, and alleys,
or from cesspools, privies, drain pipes, sewers, etc., were prevalent
in the tenant-house districts, creating, as usual, a vast amount of
sickness, and a large infant mortality. Very generally these diseases
were directly traceable to the decomposing filth, and in some instances
were stopped by the removal of the nuisance.

The Inspector of the Eighth Ward reports: "Cholera infantum has
probably consigned many more to the grave during the past summer than
all other diseases in my inspection district. In every case examined I
have found it associated with some well-marked course of insalubrity;
vegetable and animal decomposition have been the most prominent causes.
That fifty per cent die from preventable causes in my inspection
district I do not doubt."

The Inspector of the Sixth Ward says: "The mortality among children is
fearfully high, many families having lost all their children; others
four out of five or six."
Tenth Ward: The most prominent diseases during the past year have been
phthisis, typhoid and scarlet fevers, cholera infantum, dysentery,
smallpox, and diphtheria. They were most prevalent in the poorest part
of the district, having the lowest ground, the filthiest streets, and
the most dense population of poor and careless people, who are crowded
in the numerous tenant-houses, shanties, and small dwellings, which
were built for one or two families, but are now made to contain from
five to ten.

Nineteenth Ward: The diseases that have chiefly prevailed during the
past season are dysentery, diarrhoea, cholera morbus, cholera infantum
and the exanthematous fevers. They were of the most frequent occurrence
in the most crowded and insalubrious quarters.

Fifteenth Ward: Since the commencement of the survey, scarlet fever,
typhoid fever, smallpox, and cholera infantum have prevailed in the
tenant-houses of this ward. Six cases of smallpox occurred in one of
three thickly peopled rows of such dwellings, and the disease was
communicated to a child in an adjacent street, who had been playing in
the infected neighborhood. Seven cases of typhoid also occurred in a

are sufficient to show that smallpox spreads uncontrolled throughout
our city. And they show, too, how this disease is disseminated abroad.
Says the Inspector of the Fourth Ward:


[Sidenote: Smallpox in Tailored Garments]

"In localities where smallpox prevailed I found, in some instances
within a few feet of the patients, tailors at work for our best
clothing establishments. Such infected vestments--worse than the tunic
of the Centaur--bring disease and death not only to the wearers, but
to many others. The occupant of the crowded tenant-house procures from
such a source a coat or a blanket, and soon a loathsome pest attacks
the young and unprotected members of his family, and ultimately spreads
through the entire quarter, destroying life after life and endangering
the health of a whole community.

"Smallpox, suddenly breaking out in some secluded rural district, often
owes its unsuspected origin to the above causes. In the remote solitude
of the ocean the seaman opens the chest in which he has deposited such
obnoxious apparel, and from this Pandora's box scatters the seeds of
pestilence among his comrades, which, ripening, shall spread its germs
to distant ports."

Or, what is more striking, take the following from the report of the
Inspector of the Fifth Ward:

"The largest wholesale establishments for the sale of dry goods
on this side of the Atlantic Ocean are in immediate contact with
the tenant-houses of the worst class, and which are infested with
smallpox and typhus fever. The two freight depots and the principal
passenger depot of the Railroad Company are in the same close
association with these nests of infection. In the region immediately
surrounding are also situated several hotels, and a large number of
boarding-houses, whose inmates are thus in danger of personal contact
with these diseases any moment. West Broadway, running through the
very centre of the district, is traversed by five different lines of
railway cars, with an average of five cars passing every minute, and
carrying millions of passengers yearly by the very doors of these
houses. Broadway, at but a short distance removed, is the principal
thoroughfare of the city. Hudson Street on the west is also a leading
route for city travel; and the cross streets of the district are
traversed daily by multitudes to reach various lines of steamboats,
cars, and steamships, which leave the city opposite this point.

[Illustration: A REGION OF SMALLPOX AND TYPHUS FEVER, 1865]

"All this large amount of daily travel passes through a region always
containing cases of typhus fever, and largely infected with smallpox.
Is it any cause of surprise that cases of these diseases are here
contracted, to be carried to distant sections of the country, there to
develop themselves, to the surprise and alarm of whole neighborhoods?
It is also well to remember that several large livery stables
are located in the immediate neighborhood, whose vehicles, it is
well-known, are frequently employed to carry persons, suffering from
these diseases, to hospitals, or to attend at funerals. These vehicles
are, perhaps, immediately afterward driven to the various car and
steamboat lines to secure passengers, who are thus exposed in the most
dangerous manner to these diseases."


[Sidenote: Typhus Fever]

Second only to smallpox as a preventable disease, but of a more fatal
character, is typhus fever. Typhus is greatly aggravated by domestic
filth, and by overcrowding, with deficient ventilation. The inspectors
found and located by street and number no less than 2,000 cases of this
most contagious and fatal disease. Commencing in a large tenant-house
in Mulberry Street, it was traced from locality to locality, in the
poorer quarters, until it was found to have visited nearly every
section of the city. It became localized in many tenant-houses and
streets, where it still remains, causing a large amount of sickness and
mortality.

At Mulberry Street, in a notoriously filthy house, it has existed
for more than four years. This house has a population of about 320,
which is renewed every few months. During the period alluded to, there
have been no less than 60 deaths by fever in this single house, and
240 cases. To-day this fever is raging uncontrolled in that house,
creating more orphans than many well-fought battles. Every new family
which enters these infected quarters is sure to fall a victim to this
pestilential disease.

[Illustration: PLAN OF FEVER-NEST, EAST 17TH STREET, 1865

_Here 85 Cases of Typhus Occurred in One Season_]

The tenant-house No. -- East Seventeenth Street, which reaks with
filth, gives the same history; upward of 85 cases, with a large
percentage of deaths, occurred in this single house during the past
season. And still it remained unclean and open to new tenants. I
could mention scores of these houses in every part of the tenant-house
district where typhus has apparently taken up its abode, and from
whence it sends out in every direction its deadly streams.

Not only have single houses become centres of contagion, but this
fever has, in many instances, become localized in crowded streets,
which to-day are almost impassable on account of the heaps of garbage,
and the courts and alleys of which are reeking with filth, making
them great centres of pestilence. From many of these tenements whole
families have been swept away.

[Illustration: BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF FEVER-NEST, 1865, NOT FAR FROM
BROADWAY AND FIFTH AVENUE]

Jersey Street, a short but uncleaned avenue, adjacent to a fashionable
part of Broadway, is another great depot of fever, which, according to
these records, frequently contained upward of thirty cases in progress
at one time. East Eleventh Street, between First and Second Avenues,
now, as all the past summer, in a horribly filthy condition, is a
local habitation of fever of the worst type. The same statement may be
made of nearly every district where the tenant-houses are especially
crowded, and the streets, courts, and alleys are unusually filthy.


[Sidenote: Intestinal Affections]

Intestinal diseases, as cholera infantum, diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid
fever, etc., which arise from, or are intensely aggravated by the
emanations from putrescible material in streets, courts, and alleys,
or from cesspools, privies, drain pipes, sewers, etc., were prevalent
in the tenant-house districts, creating, as usual, a vast amount of
sickness, and a large infant mortality. Very generally these diseases
were directly traceable to the decomposing filth, and in some instances
were stopped by the removal of the nuisance.

The Inspector of the Eighth Ward reports: "Cholera infantum has
probably consigned many more to the grave during the past summer than
all other diseases in my inspection district. In every case examined I
have found it associated with some well-marked course of insalubrity;
vegetable and animal decomposition have been the most prominent causes.
That fifty per cent die from preventable causes in my inspection
district I do not doubt."

The Inspector of the Sixth Ward says: "The mortality among children is
fearfully high, many families having lost all their children; others
four out of five or six."
Tenth Ward: The most prominent diseases during the past year have been
phthisis, typhoid and scarlet fevers, cholera infantum, dysentery,
smallpox, and diphtheria. They were most prevalent in the poorest part
of the district, having the lowest ground, the filthiest streets, and
the most dense population of poor and careless people, who are crowded
in the numerous tenant-houses, shanties, and small dwellings, which
were built for one or two families, but are now made to contain from
five to ten.

Nineteenth Ward: The diseases that have chiefly prevailed during the
past season are dysentery, diarrhoea, cholera morbus, cholera infantum
and the exanthematous fevers. They were of the most frequent occurrence
in the most crowded and insalubrious quarters.

Fifteenth Ward: Since the commencement of the survey, scarlet fever,
typhoid fever, smallpox, and cholera infantum have prevailed in the
tenant-houses of this ward. Six cases of smallpox occurred in one of
three thickly peopled rows of such dwellings, and the disease was
communicated to a child in an adjacent street, who had been playing in
the infected neighborhood. Seven cases of typhoid also occurred in a
court among children, and this was within a few doors of better class
houses.

Eleventh Ward: Typhus and typhoid fevers have been found prevailing
in all sections of this district. Smallpox, scarlatina, measles, and
pulmonary diseases are met with in almost every street. Typhus is the
most typical of the preventable diseases that abound in the Eleventh
Ward. Cholera infantum and obstinate diarrhoeal maladies were prevalent
in the rear tenements and throughout the lowest streets during the
summer and autumn.

To give you an idea of the wide prevalence of these diseases, I will
notice one or two more in detail.


[Sidenote: Smallpox]

Smallpox is the very type of preventable diseases. We have a safe
and sure preventive in thorough vaccination. And yet this loathsome
disease is at this moment an epidemic in New York. In two days' time,
the inspectors found 644 cases, and in two weeks, upward of 1,200;
and it was estimated that only about one-half were discovered. In
many large tenant-houses, six, eight, and ten cases were found at the
same time. They found it under every conceivable condition tending to
promote its communicability. It was in the street cars, in the stages,
in the hacks, on the ferry-boats, in junk-shops, in cigar-stores,
in candy-shops, in the families of tailors and seamstresses, who
were making clothing for wholesale stores, in public and in private
charities. I hold in my hand a list of cases of smallpox found
existing under circumstances which show how widespread is this disease.
Bedding of a fatal case of smallpox was sold to a rag-man; case in a
room where candy and daily papers were sold; case on a ferry-boat;
woman was attending bar and acting as nurse to her husband who had
smallpox; girl who was making cigars while scabs were falling from her
skin; seamstress who was making shirts for a Broadway store, one of
which was thrown over the cradle of a child sick of smallpox; tailors
making soldiers' clothing, have their children, from whom the scabs
were falling, wrapped in the garments; a woman selling vegetables had
the scabs falling from her face, among the vegetables, etc., etc.
Instances of this kind can be quoted at any length, but these examples
are sufficient to show that smallpox spreads uncontrolled throughout
our city. And they show, too, how this disease is disseminated abroad.

"All this large amount of daily travel passes through a region always
containing cases of typhus fever, and largely infected with smallpox.
Is it any cause of surprise that cases of these diseases are here
contracted, to be carried to distant sections of the country, there to
develop themselves, to the surprise and alarm of whole neighborhoods?
It is also well to remember that several large livery stables
are located in the immediate neighborhood, whose vehicles, it is
well-known, are frequently employed to carry persons, suffering from
these diseases, to hospitals, or to attend at funerals. These vehicles
are, perhaps, immediately afterward driven to the various car and
steamboat lines to secure passengers, who are thus exposed in the most
dangerous manner to these diseases."


[Sidenote: Typhus Fever]

Second only to smallpox as a preventable disease, but of a more fatal
character, is typhus fever. Typhus is greatly aggravated by domestic
filth, and by overcrowding, with deficient ventilation. The inspectors
found and located by street and number no less than 2,000 cases of this
most contagious and fatal disease. Commencing in a large tenant-house
in Mulberry Street, it was traced from locality to locality, in the
poorer quarters, until it was found to have visited nearly every
section of the city. It became localized in many tenant-houses and
streets, where it still remains, causing a large amount of sickness and
mortality.

At Mulberry Street, in a notoriously filthy house, it has existed
for more than four years. This house has a population of about 320,
which is renewed every few months. During the period alluded to, there
have been no less than 60 deaths by fever in this single house, and
240 cases. To-day this fever is raging uncontrolled in that house,
creating more orphans than many well-fought battles. Every new family
which enters these infected quarters is sure to fall a victim to this
pestilential disease.

[Illustration: PLAN OF FEVER-NEST, EAST 17TH STREET, 1865

_Here 85 Cases of Typhus Occurred in One Season_]

The tenant-house No. -- East Seventeenth Street, which reaks with
filth, gives the same history; upward of 85 cases, with a large
percentage of deaths, occurred in this single house during the past
season. And still it remained unclean and open to new tenants. I
could mention scores of these houses in every part of the tenant-house
district where typhus has apparently taken up its abode, and from
whence it sends out in every direction its deadly streams.

Not only have single houses become centres of contagion, but this
fever has, in many instances, become localized in crowded streets,
which to-day are almost impassable on account of the heaps of garbage,
and the courts and alleys of which are reeking with filth, making
them great centres of pestilence. From many of these tenements whole
families have been swept away.

[Illustration: BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF FEVER-NEST, 1865, NOT FAR FROM
BROADWAY AND FIFTH AVENUE]

Jersey Street, a short but uncleaned avenue, adjacent to a fashionable
part of Broadway, is another great depot of fever, which, according to
these records, frequently contained upward of thirty cases in progress
at one time. East Eleventh Street, between First and Second Avenues,
now, as all the past summer, in a horribly filthy condition, is a
local habitation of fever of the worst type. The same statement may be
made of nearly every district where the tenant-houses are especially
crowded, and the streets, courts, and alleys are unusually filthy.


[Sidenote: Intestinal Affections]

Intestinal diseases, as cholera infantum, diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid
fever, etc., which arise from, or are intensely aggravated by the
emanations from putrescible material in streets, courts, and alleys,
or from cesspools, privies, drain pipes, sewers, etc., were prevalent
in the tenant-house districts, creating, as usual, a vast amount of
sickness, and a large infant mortality. Very generally these diseases
were directly traceable to the decomposing filth, and in some instances
were stopped by the removal of the nuisance.

The Inspector of the Eighth Ward reports: "Cholera infantum has
probably consigned many more to the grave during the past summer than
all other diseases in my inspection district. In every case examined I
have found it associated with some well-marked course of insalubrity;
vegetable and animal decomposition have been the most prominent causes.
That fifty per cent die from preventable causes in my inspection
district I do not doubt."

The Inspector of the Sixth Ward says: "The mortality among children is
fearfully high, many families having lost all their children; others
four out of five or six."
Tenth Ward: The most prominent diseases during the past year have been
phthisis, typhoid and scarlet fevers, cholera infantum, dysentery,
smallpox, and diphtheria. They were most prevalent in the poorest part
of the district, having the lowest ground, the filthiest streets, and
the most dense population of poor and careless people, who are crowded
in the numerous tenant-houses, shanties, and small dwellings, which
were built for one or two families, but are now made to contain from
five to ten.

Nineteenth Ward: The diseases that have chiefly prevailed during the
past season are dysentery, diarrhoea, cholera morbus, cholera infantum
and the exanthematous fevers. They were of the most frequent occurrence
in the most crowded and insalubrious quarters.

Fifteenth Ward: Since the commencement of the survey, scarlet fever,
typhoid fever, smallpox, and cholera infantum have prevailed in the
tenant-houses of this ward. Six cases of smallpox occurred in one of
three thickly peopled rows of such dwellings, and the disease was
communicated to a child in an adjacent street, who had been playing in
the infected neighborhood. Seven cases of typhoid also occurred in a
court among children, and this was within a few doors of better class
houses.

Eleventh Ward: Typhus and typhoid fevers have been found prevailing
in all sections of this district. Smallpox, scarlatina, measles, and
pulmonary diseases are met with in almost every street. Typhus is the
most typical of the preventable diseases that abound in the Eleventh
Ward. Cholera infantum and obstinate diarrhoeal maladies were prevalent
in the rear tenements and throughout the lowest streets during the
summer and autumn.

To give you an idea of the wide prevalence of these diseases, I will
notice one or two more in detail.


[Sidenote: Smallpox]

Smallpox is the very type of preventable diseases. We have a safe
and sure preventive in thorough vaccination. And yet this loathsome
disease is at this moment an epidemic in New York. In two days' time,
the inspectors found 644 cases, and in two weeks, upward of 1,200;
and it was estimated that only about one-half were discovered. In
many large tenant-houses, six, eight, and ten cases were found at the
same time. They found it under every conceivable condition tending to
promote its communicability. It was in the street cars, in the stages,
in the hacks, on the ferry-boats, in junk-shops, in cigar-stores,
in candy-shops, in the families of tailors and seamstresses, who
were making clothing for wholesale stores, in public and in private
charities. I hold in my hand a list of cases of smallpox found
existing under circumstances which show how widespread is this disease.
Bedding of a fatal case of smallpox was sold to a rag-man; case in a
room where candy and daily papers were sold; case on a ferry-boat;
woman was attending bar and acting as nurse to her husband who had
smallpox; girl who was making cigars while scabs were falling from her
skin; seamstress who was making shirts for a Broadway store, one of
which was thrown over the cradle of a child sick of smallpox; tailors
making soldiers' clothing, have their children, from whom the scabs
were falling, wrapped in the garments; a woman selling vegetables had
the scabs falling from her face, among the vegetables, etc., etc.
Instances of this kind can be quoted at any length, but these examples
are sufficient to show that smallpox spreads uncontrolled throughout
our city. And they show, too, how this disease is disseminated abroad.
Says the Inspector of the Fourth Ward:


[Sidenote: Smallpox in Tailored Garments]

"In localities where smallpox prevailed I found, in some instances
within a few feet of the patients, tailors at work for our best
clothing establishments. Such infected vestments--worse than the tunic
of the Centaur--bring disease and death not only to the wearers, but
to many others. The occupant of the crowded tenant-house procures from
such a source a coat or a blanket, and soon a loathsome pest attacks
the young and unprotected members of his family, and ultimately spreads
through the entire quarter, destroying life after life and endangering
the health of a whole community.

"Smallpox, suddenly breaking out in some secluded rural district, often
owes its unsuspected origin to the above causes. In the remote solitude
of the ocean the seaman opens the chest in which he has deposited such
obnoxious apparel, and from this Pandora's box scatters the seeds of
pestilence among his comrades, which, ripening, shall spread its germs
to distant ports."

Or, what is more striking, take the following from the report of the
Inspector of the Fifth Ward:

"The largest wholesale establishments for the sale of dry goods
on this side of the Atlantic Ocean are in immediate contact with
the tenant-houses of the worst class, and which are infested with
smallpox and typhus fever. The two freight depots and the principal
passenger depot of the Railroad Company are in the same close
association with these nests of infection. In the region immediately
surrounding are also situated several hotels, and a large number of
boarding-houses, whose inmates are thus in danger of personal contact
with these diseases any moment. West Broadway, running through the
very centre of the district, is traversed by five different lines of
railway cars, with an average of five cars passing every minute, and
carrying millions of passengers yearly by the very doors of these
houses. Broadway, at but a short distance removed, is the principal
thoroughfare of the city. Hudson Street on the west is also a leading
route for city travel; and the cross streets of the district are
traversed daily by multitudes to reach various lines of steamboats,
cars, and steamships, which leave the city opposite this point.

could mention scores of these houses in every part of the tenant-house
district where typhus has apparently taken up its abode, and from
whence it sends out in every direction its deadly streams.

Not only have single houses become centres of contagion, but this
fever has, in many instances, become localized in crowded streets,
which to-day are almost impassable on account of the heaps of garbage,
and the courts and alleys of which are reeking with filth, making
them great centres of pestilence. From many of these tenements whole
families have been swept away.

[Illustration: BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF FEVER-NEST, 1865, NOT FAR FROM
BROADWAY AND FIFTH AVENUE]

Jersey Street, a short but uncleaned avenue, adjacent to a fashionable
part of Broadway, is another great depot of fever, which, according to
these records, frequently contained upward of thirty cases in progress
at one time. East Eleventh Street, between First and Second Avenues,
now, as all the past summer, in a horribly filthy condition, is a
local habitation of fever of the worst type. The same statement may be
made of nearly every district where the tenant-houses are especially
crowded, and the streets, courts, and alleys are unusually filthy.


[Sidenote: Intestinal Affections]

Intestinal diseases, as cholera infantum, diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid
fever, etc., which arise from, or are intensely aggravated by the
emanations from putrescible material in streets, courts, and alleys,
or from cesspools, privies, drain pipes, sewers, etc., were prevalent
in the tenant-house districts, creating, as usual, a vast amount of
sickness, and a large infant mortality. Very generally these diseases
were directly traceable to the decomposing filth, and in some instances
were stopped by the removal of the nuisance.

The Inspector of the Eighth Ward reports: "Cholera infantum has
probably consigned many more to the grave during the past summer than
all other diseases in my inspection district. In every case examined I
have found it associated with some well-marked course of insalubrity;
vegetable and animal decomposition have been the most prominent causes.
That fifty per cent die from preventable causes in my inspection
district I do not doubt."

The Inspector of the Sixth Ward says: "The mortality among children is
fearfully high, many families having lost all their children; others
four out of five or six."
Tenth Ward: The most prominent diseases during the past year have been
phthisis, typhoid and scarlet fevers, cholera infantum, dysentery,
smallpox, and diphtheria. They were most prevalent in the poorest part
of the district, having the lowest ground, the filthiest streets, and
the most dense population of poor and careless people, who are crowded
in the numerous tenant-houses, shanties, and small dwellings, which
were built for one or two families, but are now made to contain from
five to ten.

Nineteenth Ward: The diseases that have chiefly prevailed during the
past season are dysentery, diarrhoea, cholera morbus, cholera infantum
and the exanthematous fevers. They were of the most frequent occurrence
in the most crowded and insalubrious quarters.

Fifteenth Ward: Since the commencement of the survey, scarlet fever,
typhoid fever, smallpox, and cholera infantum have prevailed in the
tenant-houses of this ward. Six cases of smallpox occurred in one of
three thickly peopled rows of such dwellings, and the disease was
communicated to a child in an adjacent street, who had been playing in
the infected neighborhood. Seven cases of typhoid also occurred in a
court among children, and this was within a few doors of better class
houses.

Eleventh Ward: Typhus and typhoid fevers have been found prevailing
in all sections of this district. Smallpox, scarlatina, measles, and
pulmonary diseases are met with in almost every street. Typhus is the
most typical of the preventable diseases that abound in the Eleventh
Ward. Cholera infantum and obstinate diarrhoeal maladies were prevalent
in the rear tenements and throughout the lowest streets during the
summer and autumn.

To give you an idea of the wide prevalence of these diseases, I will
notice one or two more in detail.


[Sidenote: Smallpox]

Smallpox is the very type of preventable diseases. We have a safe
and sure preventive in thorough vaccination. And yet this loathsome
disease is at this moment an epidemic in New York. In two days' time,
the inspectors found 644 cases, and in two weeks, upward of 1,200;
and it was estimated that only about one-half were discovered. In
many large tenant-houses, six, eight, and ten cases were found at the
same time. They found it under every conceivable condition tending to
promote its communicability. It was in the street cars, in the stages,
in the hacks, on the ferry-boats, in junk-shops, in cigar-stores,
in candy-shops, in the families of tailors and seamstresses, who
were making clothing for wholesale stores, in public and in private
charities. I hold in my hand a list of cases of smallpox found
existing under circumstances which show how widespread is this disease.
Bedding of a fatal case of smallpox was sold to a rag-man; case in a
room where candy and daily papers were sold; case on a ferry-boat;
woman was attending bar and acting as nurse to her husband who had
smallpox; girl who was making cigars while scabs were falling from her
skin; seamstress who was making shirts for a Broadway store, one of
which was thrown over the cradle of a child sick of smallpox; tailors
making soldiers' clothing, have their children, from whom the scabs
were falling, wrapped in the garments; a woman selling vegetables had
the scabs falling from her face, among the vegetables, etc., etc.
Instances of this kind can be quoted at any length, but these examples
are sufficient to show that smallpox spreads uncontrolled throughout
our city. And they show, too, how this disease is disseminated abroad.
Says the Inspector of the Fourth Ward:


[Sidenote: Smallpox in Tailored Garments]

"In localities where smallpox prevailed I found, in some instances
within a few feet of the patients, tailors at work for our best
clothing establishments. Such infected vestments--worse than the tunic
of the Centaur--bring disease and death not only to the wearers, but
to many others. The occupant of the crowded tenant-house procures from
such a source a coat or a blanket, and soon a loathsome pest attacks
the young and unprotected members of his family, and ultimately spreads
through the entire quarter, destroying life after life and endangering
the health of a whole community.

"Smallpox, suddenly breaking out in some secluded rural district, often
owes its unsuspected origin to the above causes. In the remote solitude
of the ocean the seaman opens the chest in which he has deposited such
obnoxious apparel, and from this Pandora's box scatters the seeds of
pestilence among his comrades, which, ripening, shall spread its germs
to distant ports."

Or, what is more striking, take the following from the report of the
Inspector of the Fifth Ward:

"The largest wholesale establishments for the sale of dry goods
on this side of the Atlantic Ocean are in immediate contact with
the tenant-houses of the worst class, and which are infested with
smallpox and typhus fever. The two freight depots and the principal
passenger depot of the Railroad Company are in the same close
association with these nests of infection. In the region immediately
surrounding are also situated several hotels, and a large number of
boarding-houses, whose inmates are thus in danger of personal contact
with these diseases any moment. West Broadway, running through the
very centre of the district, is traversed by five different lines of
railway cars, with an average of five cars passing every minute, and
carrying millions of passengers yearly by the very doors of these
houses. Broadway, at but a short distance removed, is the principal
thoroughfare of the city. Hudson Street on the west is also a leading
route for city travel; and the cross streets of the district are
traversed daily by multitudes to reach various lines of steamboats,
cars, and steamships, which leave the city opposite this point.

[Illustration: A REGION OF SMALLPOX AND TYPHUS FEVER, 1865]

"All this large amount of daily travel passes through a region always
containing cases of typhus fever, and largely infected with smallpox.
Is it any cause of surprise that cases of these diseases are here
contracted, to be carried to distant sections of the country, there to
develop themselves, to the surprise and alarm of whole neighborhoods?
It is also well to remember that several large livery stables
are located in the immediate neighborhood, whose vehicles, it is
well-known, are frequently employed to carry persons, suffering from
these diseases, to hospitals, or to attend at funerals. These vehicles
are, perhaps, immediately afterward driven to the various car and
steamboat lines to secure passengers, who are thus exposed in the most
dangerous manner to these diseases."


[Sidenote: Typhus Fever]

Second only to smallpox as a preventable disease, but of a more fatal
character, is typhus fever. Typhus is greatly aggravated by domestic
filth, and by overcrowding, with deficient ventilation. The inspectors
found and located by street and number no less than 2,000 cases of this
most contagious and fatal disease. Commencing in a large tenant-house
in Mulberry Street, it was traced from locality to locality, in the
poorer quarters, until it was found to have visited nearly every
section of the city. It became localized in many tenant-houses and
streets, where it still remains, causing a large amount of sickness and
mortality.

At Mulberry Street, in a notoriously filthy house, it has existed
for more than four years. This house has a population of about 320,
which is renewed every few months. During the period alluded to, there
have been no less than 60 deaths by fever in this single house, and
240 cases. To-day this fever is raging uncontrolled in that house,
creating more orphans than many well-fought battles. Every new family
which enters these infected quarters is sure to fall a victim to this
pestilential disease.

[Illustration: PLAN OF FEVER-NEST, EAST 17TH STREET, 1865

_Here 85 Cases of Typhus Occurred in One Season_]

The tenant-house No. -- East Seventeenth Street, which reaks with
filth, gives the same history; upward of 85 cases, with a large
percentage of deaths, occurred in this single house during the past
season. And still it remained unclean and open to new tenants. I

phthisis, typhoid and scarlet fevers, cholera infantum, dysentery,
smallpox, and diphtheria. They were most prevalent in the poorest part
of the district, having the lowest ground, the filthiest streets, and
the most dense population of poor and careless people, who are crowded
in the numerous tenant-houses, shanties, and small dwellings, which
were built for one or two families, but are now made to contain from
five to ten.

Nineteenth Ward: The diseases that have chiefly prevailed during the
past season are dysentery, diarrhoea, cholera morbus, cholera infantum
and the exanthematous fevers. They were of the most frequent occurrence
in the most crowded and insalubrious quarters.

Fifteenth Ward: Since the commencement of the survey, scarlet fever,
typhoid fever, smallpox, and cholera infantum have prevailed in the
tenant-houses of this ward. Six cases of smallpox occurred in one of
three thickly peopled rows of such dwellings, and the disease was
communicated to a child in an adjacent street, who had been playing in
the infected neighborhood. Seven cases of typhoid also occurred in a
court among children, and this was within a few doors of better class
houses.

Eleventh Ward: Typhus and typhoid fevers have been found prevailing
in all sections of this district. Smallpox, scarlatina, measles, and
pulmonary diseases are met with in almost every street. Typhus is the
most typical of the preventable diseases that abound in the Eleventh
Ward. Cholera infantum and obstinate diarrhoeal maladies were prevalent
in the rear tenements and throughout the lowest streets during the
summer and autumn.

To give you an idea of the wide prevalence of these diseases, I will
notice one or two more in detail.


[Sidenote: Smallpox]

Smallpox is the very type of preventable diseases. We have a safe
and sure preventive in thorough vaccination. And yet this loathsome
disease is at this moment an epidemic in New York. In two days' time,
the inspectors found 644 cases, and in two weeks, upward of 1,200;
and it was estimated that only about one-half were discovered. In
many large tenant-houses, six, eight, and ten cases were found at the
same time. They found it under every conceivable condition tending to
promote its communicability. It was in the street cars, in the stages,
in the hacks, on the ferry-boats, in junk-shops, in cigar-stores,
in candy-shops, in the families of tailors and seamstresses, who
were making clothing for wholesale stores, in public and in private
charities. I hold in my hand a list of cases of smallpox found
existing under circumstances which show how widespread is this disease.
Bedding of a fatal case of smallpox was sold to a rag-man; case in a
room where candy and daily papers were sold; case on a ferry-boat;
woman was attending bar and acting as nurse to her husband who had
smallpox; girl who was making cigars while scabs were falling from her
skin; seamstress who was making shirts for a Broadway store, one of
which was thrown over the cradle of a child sick of smallpox; tailors
making soldiers' clothing, have their children, from whom the scabs
were falling, wrapped in the garments; a woman selling vegetables had
the scabs falling from her face, among the vegetables, etc., etc.
Instances of this kind can be quoted at any length, but these examples
are sufficient to show that smallpox spreads uncontrolled throughout
our city. And they show, too, how this disease is disseminated abroad.
Says the Inspector of the Fourth Ward:


[Sidenote: Smallpox in Tailored Garments]

"In localities where smallpox prevailed I found, in some instances
within a few feet of the patients, tailors at work for our best
clothing establishments. Such infected vestments--worse than the tunic
of the Centaur--bring disease and death not only to the wearers, but
to many others. The occupant of the crowded tenant-house procures from
such a source a coat or a blanket, and soon a loathsome pest attacks
the young and unprotected members of his family, and ultimately spreads
through the entire quarter, destroying life after life and endangering
the health of a whole community.

"Smallpox, suddenly breaking out in some secluded rural district, often
owes its unsuspected origin to the above causes. In the remote solitude
of the ocean the seaman opens the chest in which he has deposited such
obnoxious apparel, and from this Pandora's box scatters the seeds of
pestilence among his comrades, which, ripening, shall spread its germs
to distant ports."

Or, what is more striking, take the following from the report of the
Inspector of the Fifth Ward:

"The largest wholesale establishments for the sale of dry goods
on this side of the Atlantic Ocean are in immediate contact with
the tenant-houses of the worst class, and which are infested with
smallpox and typhus fever. The two freight depots and the principal
passenger depot of the Railroad Company are in the same close
association with these nests of infection. In the region immediately
surrounding are also situated several hotels, and a large number of
boarding-houses, whose inmates are thus in danger of personal contact
with these diseases any moment. West Broadway, running through the
very centre of the district, is traversed by five different lines of
railway cars, with an average of five cars passing every minute, and
carrying millions of passengers yearly by the very doors of these
houses. Broadway, at but a short distance removed, is the principal
thoroughfare of the city. Hudson Street on the west is also a leading
route for city travel; and the cross streets of the district are
traversed daily by multitudes to reach various lines of steamboats,
cars, and steamships, which leave the city opposite this point.

[Illustration: A REGION OF SMALLPOX AND TYPHUS FEVER, 1865]

"All this large amount of daily travel passes through a region always
containing cases of typhus fever, and largely infected with smallpox.
Is it any cause of surprise that cases of these diseases are here
contracted, to be carried to distant sections of the country, there to
develop themselves, to the surprise and alarm of whole neighborhoods?
It is also well to remember that several large livery stables
are located in the immediate neighborhood, whose vehicles, it is
well-known, are frequently employed to carry persons, suffering from
these diseases, to hospitals, or to attend at funerals. These vehicles
are, perhaps, immediately afterward driven to the various car and
steamboat lines to secure passengers, who are thus exposed in the most
dangerous manner to these diseases."


[Sidenote: Typhus Fever]

Second only to smallpox as a preventable disease, but of a more fatal
character, is typhus fever. Typhus is greatly aggravated by domestic
filth, and by overcrowding, with deficient ventilation. The inspectors
found and located by street and number no less than 2,000 cases of this
most contagious and fatal disease. Commencing in a large tenant-house
in Mulberry Street, it was traced from locality to locality, in the
poorer quarters, until it was found to have visited nearly every
section of the city. It became localized in many tenant-houses and
streets, where it still remains, causing a large amount of sickness and
mortality.

At Mulberry Street, in a notoriously filthy house, it has existed
for more than four years. This house has a population of about 320,
which is renewed every few months. During the period alluded to, there
have been no less than 60 deaths by fever in this single house, and
240 cases. To-day this fever is raging uncontrolled in that house,
creating more orphans than many well-fought battles. Every new family
which enters these infected quarters is sure to fall a victim to this
pestilential disease.

[Illustration: PLAN OF FEVER-NEST, EAST 17TH STREET, 1865

_Here 85 Cases of Typhus Occurred in One Season_]

The tenant-house No. -- East Seventeenth Street, which reaks with
filth, gives the same history; upward of 85 cases, with a large
percentage of deaths, occurred in this single house during the past
season. And still it remained unclean and open to new tenants. I
could mention scores of these houses in every part of the tenant-house
district where typhus has apparently taken up its abode, and from
whence it sends out in every direction its deadly streams.

Not only have single houses become centres of contagion, but this
fever has, in many instances, become localized in crowded streets,
which to-day are almost impassable on account of the heaps of garbage,
and the courts and alleys of which are reeking with filth, making
them great centres of pestilence. From many of these tenements whole
families have been swept away.

[Illustration: BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF FEVER-NEST, 1865, NOT FAR FROM
BROADWAY AND FIFTH AVENUE]

Jersey Street, a short but uncleaned avenue, adjacent to a fashionable
part of Broadway, is another great depot of fever, which, according to
these records, frequently contained upward of thirty cases in progress
at one time. East Eleventh Street, between First and Second Avenues,
now, as all the past summer, in a horribly filthy condition, is a
local habitation of fever of the worst type. The same statement may be
made of nearly every district where the tenant-houses are especially
crowded, and the streets, courts, and alleys are unusually filthy.


[Sidenote: Intestinal Affections]

Intestinal diseases, as cholera infantum, diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid
fever, etc., which arise from, or are intensely aggravated by the
emanations from putrescible material in streets, courts, and alleys,
or from cesspools, privies, drain pipes, sewers, etc., were prevalent
in the tenant-house districts, creating, as usual, a vast amount of
sickness, and a large infant mortality. Very generally these diseases
were directly traceable to the decomposing filth, and in some instances
were stopped by the removal of the nuisance.

The Inspector of the Eighth Ward reports: "Cholera infantum has
probably consigned many more to the grave during the past summer than
all other diseases in my inspection district. In every case examined I
have found it associated with some well-marked course of insalubrity;
vegetable and animal decomposition have been the most prominent causes.
That fifty per cent die from preventable causes in my inspection
district I do not doubt."

The Inspector of the Sixth Ward says: "The mortality among children is
fearfully high, many families having lost all their children; others
four out of five or six."
Tenth Ward: The most prominent diseases during the past year have been
phthisis, typhoid and scarlet fevers, cholera infantum, dysentery,

in candy-shops, in the families of tailors and seamstresses, who
were making clothing for wholesale stores, in public and in private
charities. I hold in my hand a list of cases of smallpox found
existing under circumstances which show how widespread is this disease.
Bedding of a fatal case of smallpox was sold to a rag-man; case in a
room where candy and daily papers were sold; case on a ferry-boat;
woman was attending bar and acting as nurse to her husband who had
smallpox; girl who was making cigars while scabs were falling from her
skin; seamstress who was making shirts for a Broadway store, one of
which was thrown over the cradle of a child sick of smallpox; tailors
making soldiers' clothing, have their children, from whom the scabs
were falling, wrapped in the garments; a woman selling vegetables had
the scabs falling from her face, among the vegetables, etc., etc.
Instances of this kind can be quoted at any length, but these examples
are sufficient to show that smallpox spreads uncontrolled throughout
our city. And they show, too, how this disease is disseminated abroad.
Says the Inspector of the Fourth Ward:


[Sidenote: Smallpox in Tailored Garments]

"In localities where smallpox prevailed I found, in some instances
within a few feet of the patients, tailors at work for our best
clothing establishments. Such infected vestments--worse than the tunic
of the Centaur--bring disease and death not only to the wearers, but
to many others. The occupant of the crowded tenant-house procures from
such a source a coat or a blanket, and soon a loathsome pest attacks
the young and unprotected members of his family, and ultimately spreads
through the entire quarter, destroying life after life and endangering
the health of a whole community.

"Smallpox, suddenly breaking out in some secluded rural district, often
owes its unsuspected origin to the above causes. In the remote solitude
of the ocean the seaman opens the chest in which he has deposited such
obnoxious apparel, and from this Pandora's box scatters the seeds of
pestilence among his comrades, which, ripening, shall spread its germs
to distant ports."

Or, what is more striking, take the following from the report of the
Inspector of the Fifth Ward:

"The largest wholesale establishments for the sale of dry goods
on this side of the Atlantic Ocean are in immediate contact with
the tenant-houses of the worst class, and which are infested with
smallpox and typhus fever. The two freight depots and the principal
passenger depot of the Railroad Company are in the same close
association with these nests of infection. In the region immediately
surrounding are also situated several hotels, and a large number of
boarding-houses, whose inmates are thus in danger of personal contact
with these diseases any moment. West Broadway, running through the
very centre of the district, is traversed by five different lines of
railway cars, with an average of five cars passing every minute, and
carrying millions of passengers yearly by the very doors of these
houses. Broadway, at but a short distance removed, is the principal
thoroughfare of the city. Hudson Street on the west is also a leading
route for city travel; and the cross streets of the district are
traversed daily by multitudes to reach various lines of steamboats,
cars, and steamships, which leave the city opposite this point.

[Illustration: A REGION OF SMALLPOX AND TYPHUS FEVER, 1865]

"All this large amount of daily travel passes through a region always
containing cases of typhus fever, and largely infected with smallpox.
Is it any cause of surprise that cases of these diseases are here
contracted, to be carried to distant sections of the country, there to
develop themselves, to the surprise and alarm of whole neighborhoods?
It is also well to remember that several large livery stables
are located in the immediate neighborhood, whose vehicles, it is
well-known, are frequently employed to carry persons, suffering from
these diseases, to hospitals, or to attend at funerals. These vehicles
are, perhaps, immediately afterward driven to the various car and
steamboat lines to secure passengers, who are thus exposed in the most
dangerous manner to these diseases."


[Sidenote: Typhus Fever]

Second only to smallpox as a preventable disease, but of a more fatal
character, is typhus fever. Typhus is greatly aggravated by domestic
filth, and by overcrowding, with deficient ventilation. The inspectors
found and located by street and number no less than 2,000 cases of this
most contagious and fatal disease. Commencing in a large tenant-house
in Mulberry Street, it was traced from locality to locality, in the
poorer quarters, until it was found to have visited nearly every
section of the city. It became localized in many tenant-houses and
streets, where it still remains, causing a large amount of sickness and
mortality.

At Mulberry Street, in a notoriously filthy house, it has existed
for more than four years. This house has a population of about 320,
which is renewed every few months. During the period alluded to, there
have been no less than 60 deaths by fever in this single house, and
240 cases. To-day this fever is raging uncontrolled in that house,
creating more orphans than many well-fought battles. Every new family
which enters these infected quarters is sure to fall a victim to this
pestilential disease.

[Illustration: PLAN OF FEVER-NEST, EAST 17TH STREET, 1865

_Here 85 Cases of Typhus Occurred in One Season_]

The tenant-house No. -- East Seventeenth Street, which reaks with
filth, gives the same history; upward of 85 cases, with a large
percentage of deaths, occurred in this single house during the past
season. And still it remained unclean and open to new tenants. I
could mention scores of these houses in every part of the tenant-house
district where typhus has apparently taken up its abode, and from
whence it sends out in every direction its deadly streams.

Not only have single houses become centres of contagion, but this
fever has, in many instances, become localized in crowded streets,
which to-day are almost impassable on account of the heaps of garbage,
and the courts and alleys of which are reeking with filth, making
them great centres of pestilence. From many of these tenements whole
families have been swept away.

[Illustration: BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF FEVER-NEST, 1865, NOT FAR FROM
BROADWAY AND FIFTH AVENUE]

Jersey Street, a short but uncleaned avenue, adjacent to a fashionable
part of Broadway, is another great depot of fever, which, according to
these records, frequently contained upward of thirty cases in progress
at one time. East Eleventh Street, between First and Second Avenues,
now, as all the past summer, in a horribly filthy condition, is a
local habitation of fever of the worst type. The same statement may be
made of nearly every district where the tenant-houses are especially
crowded, and the streets, courts, and alleys are unusually filthy.


[Sidenote: Intestinal Affections]

Intestinal diseases, as cholera infantum, diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid
fever, etc., which arise from, or are intensely aggravated by the
emanations from putrescible material in streets, courts, and alleys,
or from cesspools, privies, drain pipes, sewers, etc., were prevalent
in the tenant-house districts, creating, as usual, a vast amount of
sickness, and a large infant mortality. Very generally these diseases
were directly traceable to the decomposing filth, and in some instances
were stopped by the removal of the nuisance.

The Inspector of the Eighth Ward reports: "Cholera infantum has
probably consigned many more to the grave during the past summer than
all other diseases in my inspection district. In every case examined I
have found it associated with some well-marked course of insalubrity;
vegetable and animal decomposition have been the most prominent causes.
That fifty per cent die from preventable causes in my inspection
district I do not doubt."

The Inspector of the Sixth Ward says: "The mortality among children is
fearfully high, many families having lost all their children; others
four out of five or six."
Tenth Ward: The most prominent diseases during the past year have been
phthisis, typhoid and scarlet fevers, cholera infantum, dysentery,
smallpox, and diphtheria. They were most prevalent in the poorest part
of the district, having the lowest ground, the filthiest streets, and
the most dense population of poor and careless people, who are crowded
in the numerous tenant-houses, shanties, and small dwellings, which
were built for one or two families, but are now made to contain from
five to ten.

Nineteenth Ward: The diseases that have chiefly prevailed during the
past season are dysentery, diarrhoea, cholera morbus, cholera infantum
and the exanthematous fevers. They were of the most frequent occurrence
in the most crowded and insalubrious quarters.

Fifteenth Ward: Since the commencement of the survey, scarlet fever,
typhoid fever, smallpox, and cholera infantum have prevailed in the
tenant-houses of this ward. Six cases of smallpox occurred in one of
three thickly peopled rows of such dwellings, and the disease was
communicated to a child in an adjacent street, who had been playing in
the infected neighborhood. Seven cases of typhoid also occurred in a
court among children, and this was within a few doors of better class
houses.

Eleventh Ward: Typhus and typhoid fevers have been found prevailing
in all sections of this district. Smallpox, scarlatina, measles, and
pulmonary diseases are met with in almost every street. Typhus is the
most typical of the preventable diseases that abound in the Eleventh
Ward. Cholera infantum and obstinate diarrhoeal maladies were prevalent
in the rear tenements and throughout the lowest streets during the
summer and autumn.

To give you an idea of the wide prevalence of these diseases, I will
notice one or two more in detail.


[Sidenote: Smallpox]

Smallpox is the very type of preventable diseases. We have a safe
and sure preventive in thorough vaccination. And yet this loathsome
disease is at this moment an epidemic in New York. In two days' time,
the inspectors found 644 cases, and in two weeks, upward of 1,200;
and it was estimated that only about one-half were discovered. In
many large tenant-houses, six, eight, and ten cases were found at the
same time. They found it under every conceivable condition tending to
promote its communicability. It was in the street cars, in the stages,
in the hacks, on the ferry-boats, in junk-shops, in cigar-stores,
in candy-shops, in the families of tailors and seamstresses, who
were making clothing for wholesale stores, in public and in private

smallpox and typhus fever. The two freight depots and the principal
passenger depot of the Railroad Company are in the same close
association with these nests of infection. In the region immediately
surrounding are also situated several hotels, and a large number of
boarding-houses, whose inmates are thus in danger of personal contact
with these diseases any moment. West Broadway, running through the
very centre of the district, is traversed by five different lines of
railway cars, with an average of five cars passing every minute, and
carrying millions of passengers yearly by the very doors of these
houses. Broadway, at but a short distance removed, is the principal
thoroughfare of the city. Hudson Street on the west is also a leading
route for city travel; and the cross streets of the district are
traversed daily by multitudes to reach various lines of steamboats,
cars, and steamships, which leave the city opposite this point.

[Illustration: A REGION OF SMALLPOX AND TYPHUS FEVER, 1865]

"All this large amount of daily travel passes through a region always
containing cases of typhus fever, and largely infected with smallpox.
Is it any cause of surprise that cases of these diseases are here
contracted, to be carried to distant sections of the country, there to
develop themselves, to the surprise and alarm of whole neighborhoods?
It is also well to remember that several large livery stables
are located in the immediate neighborhood, whose vehicles, it is
well-known, are frequently employed to carry persons, suffering from
these diseases, to hospitals, or to attend at funerals. These vehicles
are, perhaps, immediately afterward driven to the various car and
steamboat lines to secure passengers, who are thus exposed in the most
dangerous manner to these diseases."


[Sidenote: Typhus Fever]

Second only to smallpox as a preventable disease, but of a more fatal
character, is typhus fever. Typhus is greatly aggravated by domestic
filth, and by overcrowding, with deficient ventilation. The inspectors
found and located by street and number no less than 2,000 cases of this
most contagious and fatal disease. Commencing in a large tenant-house
in Mulberry Street, it was traced from locality to locality, in the
poorer quarters, until it was found to have visited nearly every
section of the city. It became localized in many tenant-houses and
streets, where it still remains, causing a large amount of sickness and
mortality.

At Mulberry Street, in a notoriously filthy house, it has existed
for more than four years. This house has a population of about 320,
which is renewed every few months. During the period alluded to, there
have been no less than 60 deaths by fever in this single house, and
240 cases. To-day this fever is raging uncontrolled in that house,
creating more orphans than many well-fought battles. Every new family
which enters these infected quarters is sure to fall a victim to this
pestilential disease.

[Illustration: PLAN OF FEVER-NEST, EAST 17TH STREET, 1865

_Here 85 Cases of Typhus Occurred in One Season_]

The tenant-house No. -- East Seventeenth Street, which reaks with
filth, gives the same history; upward of 85 cases, with a large
percentage of deaths, occurred in this single house during the past
season. And still it remained unclean and open to new tenants. I
could mention scores of these houses in every part of the tenant-house
district where typhus has apparently taken up its abode, and from
whence it sends out in every direction its deadly streams.

Not only have single houses become centres of contagion, but this
fever has, in many instances, become localized in crowded streets,
which to-day are almost impassable on account of the heaps of garbage,
and the courts and alleys of which are reeking with filth, making
them great centres of pestilence. From many of these tenements whole
families have been swept away.

[Illustration: BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF FEVER-NEST, 1865, NOT FAR FROM
BROADWAY AND FIFTH AVENUE]

Jersey Street, a short but uncleaned avenue, adjacent to a fashionable
part of Broadway, is another great depot of fever, which, according to
these records, frequently contained upward of thirty cases in progress
at one time. East Eleventh Street, between First and Second Avenues,
now, as all the past summer, in a horribly filthy condition, is a
local habitation of fever of the worst type. The same statement may be
made of nearly every district where the tenant-houses are especially
crowded, and the streets, courts, and alleys are unusually filthy.


[Sidenote: Intestinal Affections]

Intestinal diseases, as cholera infantum, diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid
fever, etc., which arise from, or are intensely aggravated by the
emanations from putrescible material in streets, courts, and alleys,
or from cesspools, privies, drain pipes, sewers, etc., were prevalent
in the tenant-house districts, creating, as usual, a vast amount of
sickness, and a large infant mortality. Very generally these diseases
were directly traceable to the decomposing filth, and in some instances
were stopped by the removal of the nuisance.

The Inspector of the Eighth Ward reports: "Cholera infantum has
probably consigned many more to the grave during the past summer than
all other diseases in my inspection district. In every case examined I
have found it associated with some well-marked course of insalubrity;
vegetable and animal decomposition have been the most prominent causes.
That fifty per cent die from preventable causes in my inspection
district I do not doubt."

The Inspector of the Sixth Ward says: "The mortality among children is
fearfully high, many families having lost all their children; others
four out of five or six."
Tenth Ward: The most prominent diseases during the past year have been
phthisis, typhoid and scarlet fevers, cholera infantum, dysentery,
smallpox, and diphtheria. They were most prevalent in the poorest part
of the district, having the lowest ground, the filthiest streets, and
the most dense population of poor and careless people, who are crowded
in the numerous tenant-houses, shanties, and small dwellings, which
were built for one or two families, but are now made to contain from
five to ten.

Nineteenth Ward: The diseases that have chiefly prevailed during the
past season are dysentery, diarrhoea, cholera morbus, cholera infantum
and the exanthematous fevers. They were of the most frequent occurrence
in the most crowded and insalubrious quarters.

Fifteenth Ward: Since the commencement of the survey, scarlet fever,
typhoid fever, smallpox, and cholera infantum have prevailed in the
tenant-houses of this ward. Six cases of smallpox occurred in one of
three thickly peopled rows of such dwellings, and the disease was
communicated to a child in an adjacent street, who had been playing in
the infected neighborhood. Seven cases of typhoid also occurred in a
court among children, and this was within a few doors of better class
houses.

Eleventh Ward: Typhus and typhoid fevers have been found prevailing
in all sections of this district. Smallpox, scarlatina, measles, and
pulmonary diseases are met with in almost every street. Typhus is the
most typical of the preventable diseases that abound in the Eleventh
Ward. Cholera infantum and obstinate diarrhoeal maladies were prevalent
in the rear tenements and throughout the lowest streets during the
summer and autumn.

To give you an idea of the wide prevalence of these diseases, I will
notice one or two more in detail.


[Sidenote: Smallpox]

Smallpox is the very type of preventable diseases. We have a safe
and sure preventive in thorough vaccination. And yet this loathsome
disease is at this moment an epidemic in New York. In two days' time,
the inspectors found 644 cases, and in two weeks, upward of 1,200;
and it was estimated that only about one-half were discovered. In
many large tenant-houses, six, eight, and ten cases were found at the
same time. They found it under every conceivable condition tending to
promote its communicability. It was in the street cars, in the stages,
in the hacks, on the ferry-boats, in junk-shops, in cigar-stores,
in candy-shops, in the families of tailors and seamstresses, who
were making clothing for wholesale stores, in public and in private
charities. I hold in my hand a list of cases of smallpox found
existing under circumstances which show how widespread is this disease.
Bedding of a fatal case of smallpox was sold to a rag-man; case in a
room where candy and daily papers were sold; case on a ferry-boat;
woman was attending bar and acting as nurse to her husband who had
smallpox; girl who was making cigars while scabs were falling from her
skin; seamstress who was making shirts for a Broadway store, one of
which was thrown over the cradle of a child sick of smallpox; tailors
making soldiers' clothing, have their children, from whom the scabs
were falling, wrapped in the garments; a woman selling vegetables had
the scabs falling from her face, among the vegetables, etc., etc.
Instances of this kind can be quoted at any length, but these examples
are sufficient to show that smallpox spreads uncontrolled throughout
our city. And they show, too, how this disease is disseminated abroad.
Says the Inspector of the Fourth Ward:


[Sidenote: Smallpox in Tailored Garments]

"In localities where smallpox prevailed I found, in some instances
within a few feet of the patients, tailors at work for our best
clothing establishments. Such infected vestments--worse than the tunic
of the Centaur--bring disease and death not only to the wearers, but
to many others. The occupant of the crowded tenant-house procures from
such a source a coat or a blanket, and soon a loathsome pest attacks
the young and unprotected members of his family, and ultimately spreads
through the entire quarter, destroying life after life and endangering
the health of a whole community.

"Smallpox, suddenly breaking out in some secluded rural district, often
owes its unsuspected origin to the above causes. In the remote solitude
of the ocean the seaman opens the chest in which he has deposited such
obnoxious apparel, and from this Pandora's box scatters the seeds of
pestilence among his comrades, which, ripening, shall spread its germs
to distant ports."

Or, what is more striking, take the following from the report of the
Inspector of the Fifth Ward:

"The largest wholesale establishments for the sale of dry goods
on this side of the Atlantic Ocean are in immediate contact with
the tenant-houses of the worst class, and which are infested with
smallpox and typhus fever. The two freight depots and the principal

for more than four years. This house has a population of about 320,
which is renewed every few months. During the period alluded to, there
have been no less than 60 deaths by fever in this single house, and
240 cases. To-day this fever is raging uncontrolled in that house,
creating more orphans than many well-fought battles. Every new family
which enters these infected quarters is sure to fall a victim to this
pestilential disease.

[Illustration: PLAN OF FEVER-NEST, EAST 17TH STREET, 1865

_Here 85 Cases of Typhus Occurred in One Season_]

The tenant-house No. -- East Seventeenth Street, which reaks with
filth, gives the same history; upward of 85 cases, with a large
percentage of deaths, occurred in this single house during the past
season. And still it remained unclean and open to new tenants. I
could mention scores of these houses in every part of the tenant-house
district where typhus has apparently taken up its abode, and from
whence it sends out in every direction its deadly streams.

Not only have single houses become centres of contagion, but this
fever has, in many instances, become localized in crowded streets,
which to-day are almost impassable on account of the heaps of garbage,
and the courts and alleys of which are reeking with filth, making
them great centres of pestilence. From many of these tenements whole
families have been swept away.

[Illustration: BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF FEVER-NEST, 1865, NOT FAR FROM
BROADWAY AND FIFTH AVENUE]

Jersey Street, a short but uncleaned avenue, adjacent to a fashionable
part of Broadway, is another great depot of fever, which, according to
these records, frequently contained upward of thirty cases in progress
at one time. East Eleventh Street, between First and Second Avenues,
now, as all the past summer, in a horribly filthy condition, is a
local habitation of fever of the worst type. The same statement may be
made of nearly every district where the tenant-houses are especially
crowded, and the streets, courts, and alleys are unusually filthy.


[Sidenote: Intestinal Affections]

Intestinal diseases, as cholera infantum, diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid
fever, etc., which arise from, or are intensely aggravated by the
emanations from putrescible material in streets, courts, and alleys,
or from cesspools, privies, drain pipes, sewers, etc., were prevalent
in the tenant-house districts, creating, as usual, a vast amount of
sickness, and a large infant mortality. Very generally these diseases
were directly traceable to the decomposing filth, and in some instances
were stopped by the removal of the nuisance.

The Inspector of the Eighth Ward reports: "Cholera infantum has
probably consigned many more to the grave during the past summer than
all other diseases in my inspection district. In every case examined I
have found it associated with some well-marked course of insalubrity;
vegetable and animal decomposition have been the most prominent causes.
That fifty per cent die from preventable causes in my inspection
district I do not doubt."

The Inspector of the Sixth Ward says: "The mortality among children is
fearfully high, many families having lost all their children; others
four out of five or six."
Tenth Ward: The most prominent diseases during the past year have been
phthisis, typhoid and scarlet fevers, cholera infantum, dysentery,
smallpox, and diphtheria. They were most prevalent in the poorest part
of the district, having the lowest ground, the filthiest streets, and
the most dense population of poor and careless people, who are crowded
in the numerous tenant-houses, shanties, and small dwellings, which
were built for one or two families, but are now made to contain from
five to ten.

Nineteenth Ward: The diseases that have chiefly prevailed during the
past season are dysentery, diarrhoea, cholera morbus, cholera infantum
and the exanthematous fevers. They were of the most frequent occurrence
in the most crowded and insalubrious quarters.

Fifteenth Ward: Since the commencement of the survey, scarlet fever,
typhoid fever, smallpox, and cholera infantum have prevailed in the
tenant-houses of this ward. Six cases of smallpox occurred in one of
three thickly peopled rows of such dwellings, and the disease was
communicated to a child in an adjacent street, who had been playing in
the infected neighborhood. Seven cases of typhoid also occurred in a
court among children, and this was within a few doors of better class
houses.

Eleventh Ward: Typhus and typhoid fevers have been found prevailing
in all sections of this district. Smallpox, scarlatina, measles, and
pulmonary diseases are met with in almost every street. Typhus is the
most typical of the preventable diseases that abound in the Eleventh
Ward. Cholera infantum and obstinate diarrhoeal maladies were prevalent
in the rear tenements and throughout the lowest streets during the
summer and autumn.

To give you an idea of the wide prevalence of these diseases, I will
notice one or two more in detail.


[Sidenote: Smallpox]

Smallpox is the very type of preventable diseases. We have a safe
and sure preventive in thorough vaccination. And yet this loathsome
disease is at this moment an epidemic in New York. In two days' time,
the inspectors found 644 cases, and in two weeks, upward of 1,200;
and it was estimated that only about one-half were discovered. In
many large tenant-houses, six, eight, and ten cases were found at the
same time. They found it under every conceivable condition tending to
promote its communicability. It was in the street cars, in the stages,
in the hacks, on the ferry-boats, in junk-shops, in cigar-stores,
in candy-shops, in the families of tailors and seamstresses, who
were making clothing for wholesale stores, in public and in private
charities. I hold in my hand a list of cases of smallpox found
existing under circumstances which show how widespread is this disease.
Bedding of a fatal case of smallpox was sold to a rag-man; case in a
room where candy and daily papers were sold; case on a ferry-boat;
woman was attending bar and acting as nurse to her husband who had
smallpox; girl who was making cigars while scabs were falling from her
skin; seamstress who was making shirts for a Broadway store, one of
which was thrown over the cradle of a child sick of smallpox; tailors
making soldiers' clothing, have their children, from whom the scabs
were falling, wrapped in the garments; a woman selling vegetables had
the scabs falling from her face, among the vegetables, etc., etc.
Instances of this kind can be quoted at any length, but these examples
are sufficient to show that smallpox spreads uncontrolled throughout
our city. And they show, too, how this disease is disseminated abroad.
Says the Inspector of the Fourth Ward:


[Sidenote: Smallpox in Tailored Garments]

"In localities where smallpox prevailed I found, in some instances
within a few feet of the patients, tailors at work for our best
clothing establishments. Such infected vestments--worse than the tunic
of the Centaur--bring disease and death not only to the wearers, but
to many others. The occupant of the crowded tenant-house procures from
such a source a coat or a blanket, and soon a loathsome pest attacks
the young and unprotected members of his family, and ultimately spreads
through the entire quarter, destroying life after life and endangering
the health of a whole community.

"Smallpox, suddenly breaking out in some secluded rural district, often
owes its unsuspected origin to the above causes. In the remote solitude
of the ocean the seaman opens the chest in which he has deposited such
obnoxious apparel, and from this Pandora's box scatters the seeds of
pestilence among his comrades, which, ripening, shall spread its germs
to distant ports."

Or, what is more striking, take the following from the report of the
Inspector of the Fifth Ward:

"The largest wholesale establishments for the sale of dry goods
on this side of the Atlantic Ocean are in immediate contact with
the tenant-houses of the worst class, and which are infested with
smallpox and typhus fever. The two freight depots and the principal
passenger depot of the Railroad Company are in the same close
association with these nests of infection. In the region immediately
surrounding are also situated several hotels, and a large number of
boarding-houses, whose inmates are thus in danger of personal contact
with these diseases any moment. West Broadway, running through the
very centre of the district, is traversed by five different lines of
railway cars, with an average of five cars passing every minute, and
carrying millions of passengers yearly by the very doors of these
houses. Broadway, at but a short distance removed, is the principal
thoroughfare of the city. Hudson Street on the west is also a leading
route for city travel; and the cross streets of the district are
traversed daily by multitudes to reach various lines of steamboats,
cars, and steamships, which leave the city opposite this point.

[Illustration: A REGION OF SMALLPOX AND TYPHUS FEVER, 1865]

"All this large amount of daily travel passes through a region always
containing cases of typhus fever, and largely infected with smallpox.
Is it any cause of surprise that cases of these diseases are here
contracted, to be carried to distant sections of the country, there to
develop themselves, to the surprise and alarm of whole neighborhoods?
It is also well to remember that several large livery stables
are located in the immediate neighborhood, whose vehicles, it is
well-known, are frequently employed to carry persons, suffering from
these diseases, to hospitals, or to attend at funerals. These vehicles
are, perhaps, immediately afterward driven to the various car and
steamboat lines to secure passengers, who are thus exposed in the most
dangerous manner to these diseases."


[Sidenote: Typhus Fever]

Second only to smallpox as a preventable disease, but of a more fatal
character, is typhus fever. Typhus is greatly aggravated by domestic
filth, and by overcrowding, with deficient ventilation. The inspectors
found and located by street and number no less than 2,000 cases of this
most contagious and fatal disease. Commencing in a large tenant-house
in Mulberry Street, it was traced from locality to locality, in the
poorer quarters, until it was found to have visited nearly every
section of the city. It became localized in many tenant-houses and
streets, where it still remains, causing a large amount of sickness and
mortality.

At Mulberry Street, in a notoriously filthy house, it has existed
for more than four years. This house has a population of about 320,
which is renewed every few months. During the period alluded to, there

in the tenant-house districts, creating, as usual, a vast amount of
sickness, and a large infant mortality. Very generally these diseases
were directly traceable to the decomposing filth, and in some instances
were stopped by the removal of the nuisance.

The Inspector of the Eighth Ward reports: "Cholera infantum has
probably consigned many more to the grave during the past summer than
all other diseases in my inspection district. In every case examined I
have found it associated with some well-marked course of insalubrity;
vegetable and animal decomposition have been the most prominent causes.
That fifty per cent die from preventable causes in my inspection
district I do not doubt."

The Inspector of the Sixth Ward says: "The mortality among children is
fearfully high, many families having lost all their children; others
four out of five or six."
